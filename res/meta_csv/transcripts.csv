susiecronin, him.,20210524-180444
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210524-180444

susiecronin," And, and so really emphasizes the particular aptitude of the persuasive game forum for dealing with political themes such as Labor migrants and war.",20210524-180444
susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210524-180444
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210524-180444

susiecronin," The mobile phone kind of keeps arising as one of the most democratic sort of platforms for and the sharing of digital narrative, so I think this fact that both.",20210524-180444
susiecronin," Of the narratives I explore here are published on phone Apps is really powerful in the sense that it creates this kind of as even as possible access, and let me see.",20210524-180444
susiecronin," So i'll skip forward a little bit because i'm conscious of time, this is the homepage of survival, so it shows the sort of six thumbnails that and.",20210524-180444
susiecronin," describe the six and levels, I was gonna say chapters i've kind of internalize the narrative too much so survival is an APP that's held.",20210524-180444
susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210524-180444
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210524-180444
susiecronin," fitting in with the game for them, and I think that's part of the fact that it's generated as a collaborative project that I believe did not receive so much funding.",20210524-180444
susiecronin, But they've done very well in order to create a piece that raises awareness that's freely available and that represents what can be done.,20210524-180444

susiecronin, And I think it was altered in some of the reviews for its simplicity and I think in some ways the way in which it's set up as a game.,20210524-180444
susiecronin," has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the Google play store reads I like it, but why does the boat level have to take so long.",20210524-180444
susiecronin, So I think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly.,20210524-180444
susiecronin," And i'm conscious of time i'm probably a exploiting the time limit, a little bit so do stop me please, and if.",20210524-180444

susiecronin," A sort of clandestine journey and to Turkey, there are a number of different sort of strands of the narrative so depending on.",20210524-180444
susiecronin, How you choose to respond you normally have two options so you're you as the user are interacting as magic was no noise husband in the narrative.,20210524-180444
susiecronin," And the tone is very sort of ludic, so I think the title very me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non Arabic speaker but it's sort of colloquialism that is quite a commonplace way of saying goodbye.",20210524-180444
susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210524-180444
susiecronin," that we need to probe here as well, to what degree, words are being placed in the characters mode what's being lost or gained in translation, but that's a whole nother.",20210524-180444

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210524-180444
susiecronin, And so I think this does work really effectively in order to generate sort of a sense of empathy with someone in the position of being separated from a loved one who's undertaking.,20210524-180444
susiecronin, A migratory trajectory.,20210524-180444

Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210526-110106
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210526-110106

susiecronin, it's almost as if she's partaking in this mischievous adventure and there is a point in which that sort of crack in the in the perfect carving of the narrative as something.,20210526-110106
susiecronin, liberating leads the user and magic to question that whole depiction so there's an element in which that flips the whole experience and it shows precisely that blockage to empathy the fact that what we've been consuming.,20210526-110106

susiecronin, him.,20210526-200406

Andy," You know, and he just said, is it is an edge list edge, so I talked a little bit about Darren Darren here which Karen doesn't want me to mention.",20210526-200406
Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210526-200406
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210526-200406
Andy, And it's and and moving towards that edge is impossible it's an aporia it's and Angeles edge because it represents.,20210526-200406
Andy, A kind of cynic Tokyo kind of representation of ourselves so i'll read otherwise we'll never in this character so users upload that live content social media reconstructing that world they take on a digital persona and step into the map social media provides the APP.,20210526-200406

Andy, it's not it's not a democratizing space in any in any way your audience is filtered by this edge rank.,20210526-200406
Andy," So what writing can occur when you write with the awareness of the processes of the edge, knowing that the that the activity.",20210526-200406
Andy," Is the data you're transacting, this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service, when you become a user and you enact the platform ISM and then, knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that's I guess the question is, how can we write.",20210526-200406

susiecronin," yeah Thank you so much, so those are two really great questions and to address the first question this idea of empathy as a hindered or block desire to help the character, I think that's really pertinent to bury me my love and, for me, and there is a point which also makes me think of.",20210526-200406
susiecronin," Some years presentation in which the female writers referred to catharsis and emancipation because there's a point and bury me my love, in which nor admits that she is tired of the abuse that she's been suffering and this.",20210526-200406
susiecronin," is something really jarring to both the user and imagine, because the way in which she depict her experience is always extremely jokey.",20210526-200406
susiecronin, it's almost as if she's partaking in this mischievous adventure and there is a point in which that sort of crack in the in the perfect carving of the narrative as something.,20210526-200406
susiecronin, liberating leads the user and magic to question that whole depiction so there's an element in which that flips the whole experience and it shows precisely that blockage to empathy the fact that what we've been consuming.,20210526-200406

Anna Nacher, My question would be Do you see any chance or any rural or significance significance for the gaps in the narrative.,20210526-200406

Anna Nacher," it's because your your presentation was so so inspiring so so that would be my question, do you see any any chance in the potential or any examples of such gaps discontinuities that would actually be you know, for me, that would be the potential to and pathetic storylines.",20210526-200406

susiecronin, him.,20210526-200211
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210526-200211

susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210526-200211

susiecronin, I shouldn't try and speak and coordinate myself at the same time can everyone see my screen.,20210526-200348
susiecronin, Perfect cool Thank you so much.,20210526-200348
susiecronin, um yes okay so i'm currently looking at the way in which online communities are formed and the way in which the iterations of Community then have sort of repercussions for understanding of.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," Mobility and privilege and travel in the present so as part of that sort of interest strand, this is something that I developed following.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," Reading the IOM world migration report in 2020 and to see that migrate narratives have been rendered in expressive digital forms, so that is to say.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," narrative forums that operate for the purpose of storytelling so we have instances of Apps, such as the Italian up working, which is a slightly game of fired up that is designed to allow migrants to.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," navigate the job market in Europe, but I think the two Apps that I look at here survival and very me my love both produced in 2017 are interesting for this kind of purity of.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, em storytelling intention and the idea that they're purely for narrative purposes and they're both gamma Phi to they're both sort of designed in such a way that they are.,20210526-200348
susiecronin, Engaging user interactivity and they use the game form but in sort of a non traditional way as i'll explore here.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," And so, because of the shortness of the discussion i'm just going to cherry pick some of the points and I was skeptical initially when I read this was my presentation on moving sorry.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, him.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," persuasive game useful here, so the persuasive game is that is designated as an art practice or a piece of instructive art, more so than a sort of marketable product designed as an enjoyable distraction from the real world.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," And, and so really emphasizes the particular aptitude of the persuasive game forum for dealing with political themes such as Labor migrants and war.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," of migrant centered content and content created and by and four people on the move, as a force that can sort of regenerate and refresh and.",20210526-200348

susiecronin," The mobile phone kind of keeps arising as one of the most democratic sort of platforms for and the sharing of digital narrative, so I think this fact that both.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," Of the narratives I explore here are published on phone Apps is really powerful in the sense that it creates this kind of as even as possible access, and let me see.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," So i'll skip forward a little bit because i'm conscious of time, this is the homepage of survival, so it shows the sort of six thumbnails that and.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," describe the six and levels, I was gonna say chapters i've kind of internalize the narrative too much so survival is an APP that's held.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210526-200348
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," fitting in with the game for them, and I think that's part of the fact that it's generated as a collaborative project that I believe did not receive so much funding.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, But they've done very well in order to create a piece that raises awareness that's freely available and that represents what can be done.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," When sort of migrant communities and locals in inverted commas, because I think that term is also quite a strangely towards realizing and work together in order to create something that allows people to navigate.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, And I think it was altered in some of the reviews for its simplicity and I think in some ways the way in which it's set up as a game.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the Google play store reads I like it, but why does the boat level have to take so long.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, So I think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," And i'm conscious of time i'm probably a exploiting the time limit, a little bit so do stop me please, and if.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, i'm going over a very me my love is a much more sort of developed project in the sense that there are multiple sort of.,20210526-200348

susiecronin, And you have a sense of the aesthetics from this.,20210526-200348

susiecronin," A sort of clandestine journey and to Turkey, there are a number of different sort of strands of the narrative so depending on.",20210526-200348
susiecronin, How you choose to respond you normally have two options so you're you as the user are interacting as magic was no noise husband in the narrative.,20210526-200348
susiecronin," And the tone is very sort of ludic, so I think the title very me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non Arabic speaker but it's sort of colloquialism that is quite a commonplace way of saying goodbye.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210526-200348
susiecronin," that we need to probe here as well, to what degree, words are being placed in the characters mode what's being lost or gained in translation, but that's a whole nother.",20210526-200348

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210526-200348
susiecronin, And so I think this does work really effectively in order to generate sort of a sense of empathy with someone in the position of being separated from a loved one who's undertaking.,20210526-200348
susiecronin, A migratory trajectory.,20210526-200348

susiecronin, yeah I think it runs just being kind I think i'm probably running over.,20210526-200348

susiecronin, apprehension and the restrictions on her in terms of not allowing her phone battery to die because she's never quite sure.,20210526-200348

susiecronin, But whether the persuasive game inverts the traditionally held perception of video games form as rooted in fantastical escapism and instead engages the player and urgent immersion and confrontation with real world issues.,20210526-200348
susiecronin, And that's sort of an open ended question that will just sort of feed into further probing of this persuasive game idea in relation to not only migrant narratives but also LGBT Q sort of narratives and the scope of.,20210526-200348

susiecronin," Share screen so i'm currently looking at migrant narratives and the ways in which these sort of contribute to, and let me just find the button, because I live on faces are over present and.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, I shouldn't try and speak and coordinate myself at the same time can everyone see my screen.,20210526-200247
susiecronin, Perfect cool Thank you so much.,20210526-200247
susiecronin, um yes okay so i'm currently looking at the way in which online communities are formed and the way in which the iterations of Community then have sort of repercussions for understanding of.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," Mobility and privilege and travel in the present so as part of that sort of interest strand, this is something that I developed following.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," Reading the IOM world migration report in 2020 and to see that migrate narratives have been rendered in expressive digital forms, so that is to say.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," narrative forums that operate for the purpose of storytelling so we have instances of Apps, such as the Italian up working, which is a slightly game of fired up that is designed to allow migrants to.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," navigate the job market in Europe, but I think the two Apps that I look at here survival and very me my love both produced in 2017 are interesting for this kind of purity of.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, em storytelling intention and the idea that they're purely for narrative purposes and they're both gamma Phi to they're both sort of designed in such a way that they are.,20210526-200247
susiecronin, Engaging user interactivity and they use the game form but in sort of a non traditional way as i'll explore here.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," And so, because of the shortness of the discussion i'm just going to cherry pick some of the points and I was skeptical initially when I read this was my presentation on moving sorry.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, him.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," persuasive game useful here, so the persuasive game is that is designated as an art practice or a piece of instructive art, more so than a sort of marketable product designed as an enjoyable distraction from the real world.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," And, and so really emphasizes the particular aptitude of the persuasive game forum for dealing with political themes such as Labor migrants and war.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," of migrant centered content and content created and by and four people on the move, as a force that can sort of regenerate and refresh and.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," contribute positively to our perception of what migrant experience is, and I think, as has arisen in sort of previous discussions in different panels.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," The mobile phone kind of keeps arising as one of the most democratic sort of platforms for and the sharing of digital narrative, so I think this fact that both.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," Of the narratives I explore here are published on phone Apps is really powerful in the sense that it creates this kind of as even as possible access, and let me see.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," So i'll skip forward a little bit because i'm conscious of time, this is the homepage of survival, so it shows the sort of six thumbnails that and.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," describe the six and levels, I was gonna say chapters i've kind of internalize the narrative too much so survival is an APP that's held.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210526-200247
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," fitting in with the game for them, and I think that's part of the fact that it's generated as a collaborative project that I believe did not receive so much funding.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, But they've done very well in order to create a piece that raises awareness that's freely available and that represents what can be done.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," When sort of migrant communities and locals in inverted commas, because I think that term is also quite a strangely towards realizing and work together in order to create something that allows people to navigate.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, And I think it was altered in some of the reviews for its simplicity and I think in some ways the way in which it's set up as a game.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the Google play store reads I like it, but why does the boat level have to take so long.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, So I think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," And i'm conscious of time i'm probably a exploiting the time limit, a little bit so do stop me please, and if.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, i'm going over a very me my love is a much more sort of developed project in the sense that there are multiple sort of.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," organizations involved, so the pixel hunt are de France and fakes and it's inexpensive it's not free to download it's also available on the APP store.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, And you have a sense of the aesthetics from this.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," and part of the advertisement for Barry my love characterization is much more developed it takes the form of instant messaging between nor, who is a migrant woman from Syria undertaking.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," A sort of clandestine journey and to Turkey, there are a number of different sort of strands of the narrative so depending on.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, How you choose to respond you normally have two options so you're you as the user are interacting as magic was no noise husband in the narrative.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," And the tone is very sort of ludic, so I think the title very me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non Arabic speaker but it's sort of colloquialism that is quite a commonplace way of saying goodbye.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210526-200247
susiecronin," that we need to probe here as well, to what degree, words are being placed in the characters mode what's being lost or gained in translation, but that's a whole nother.",20210526-200247

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210526-200247
susiecronin, And so I think this does work really effectively in order to generate sort of a sense of empathy with someone in the position of being separated from a loved one who's undertaking.,20210526-200247
susiecronin, A migratory trajectory.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," And there is also a lot of discussion of the kinds of issues that are encountered, am I doing okay for time to have.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, yeah I think it runs just being kind I think i'm probably running over.,20210526-200247

susiecronin," And, from my perspective, he is the one who's able to browse for con for news content or updates and that might give him some context as to why that is, and so you can feel noise kind of.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, apprehension and the restrictions on her in terms of not allowing her phone battery to die because she's never quite sure.,20210526-200247

susiecronin," i'll skip ahead, just to my concluding remarks because I think I should sort of start to wrap up.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, And then again i've mentioned this before the phone is an intersection between practicality and entertainment urgency and destruction.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," And it kind of operators quite a democratic platform choice, so I think the mobile APP narrative has a huge amount of potential for narratives in terms of diffusing widely and diffusing in a democratic way.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, A return to the persuasive game notion will no doubt pro fruitful in gaining a fuller understanding of the game form beyond lunatics.,20210526-200247

susiecronin, At specifically grouping together or sort of indexing games that have a social context or social justice sort of context and intention and.,20210526-200247
susiecronin," Finally, to small things i'm wondering whether and this might be very reductive for scholars with more sort of proficiency in video game studies.",20210526-200247
susiecronin, But whether the persuasive game inverts the traditionally held perception of video games form as rooted in fantastical escapism and instead engages the player and urgent immersion and confrontation with real world issues.,20210526-200247
susiecronin, And that's sort of an open ended question that will just sort of feed into further probing of this persuasive game idea in relation to not only migrant narratives but also LGBT Q sort of narratives and the scope of.,20210526-200247

Julian Hanna," there's been a lot of great scholarship on the manifesto, but most of it was written before 2008 so it's starting to get it's you know just in social media was getting started so it's it's getting.",20210526-200247
Julian Hanna," slightly out of date and that's the kind of gap i'm trying to fill, but in this case i'm just starting i'm just focusing really on the pandemic period.",20210526-200247

Andy, Of these activities together are forming you know the edge of your own profile this edge rank for yourself as a user and collectively within the platform.,20210526-200247

Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210526-200247
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210526-200247
Andy, And it's and and moving towards that edge is impossible it's an aporia it's and Angeles edge because it represents.,20210526-200247

Andy, Is that what what writing can occur when you're writing with the awareness of the processes of the edge that will allow your work to be seen in a in a particular way and it creates your audience for you.,20210526-200247
Andy, it's not it's not a democratizing space in any in any way your audience is filtered by this edge rank.,20210526-200247

Andy," Is the data you're transacting, this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service, when you become a user and you enact the platform ISM and then, knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that's I guess the question is, how can we write.",20210526-200247

Andy," Some arguments around platform ISM as an ideology, but we wanted to look at platform ISM as an ideology, because it seems to have.",20210526-123103
Andy, As Andy was saying it's eclipsed the use of the World Wide Web it has taken the audience away obviously well repositioned as as all of the examples we've seen today.,20210526-123103
Andy," In this panel have shown us obviously thriving even in these spaces and we're not denying that at all what we're saying, though, is that perhaps in the rush to occupy and to work within these spaces, there may be.",20210526-123103
Andy," There may not have been enough time to reflect on what the audiences and challenges of platform ISM are like what are we doing inside platform isn't, how is it changing the artist and the and the creative practitioner, so we wanted to establish that platform ISM.",20210526-123103
Andy, platform is we call it platform ISM and we believe very strongly that it is an ideology obviously this is reflecting what echoing.,20210526-123103

Andy," It controls, our actions or It encouraged us to act in particular ways and, and these are all the signs that point to platform ISM being an ideology, if you frame it in this way, so we.",20210526-123103

Andy, So all right so we're talking about we're talking about.,20210526-123103

Andy, The screen that i'm.,20210526-123103
Andy, That we're talking on top of here.,20210526-123103

Andy, bodily moving into the the the the map itself and we started thinking okay well there's something in this here.,20210526-123103

Andy," That edge, if you like, that later becomes the edge rank that we find in a lot of these platforms so we're drawing a conclusion at this point that the that the platform, the edge of this platform.",20210526-123103
Andy," This edge less edge in a way, is defined by the user and but defined by the multiple users as well, because the the social media application is only as strong as the number of followers as.",20210526-123103
Andy," You know, as was mentioned before, the idea of Gavin parlor and all of these.",20210526-123103
Andy, These Apps they have their followers again subscribing to the ideology of platform ISM but that communal edge is the is determined by the algorithm.,20210526-123103

Andy," You know it's better than a just a repost are alike, and then the decay that it's it's how it's like losing visibility, over time, so the idea, this will encourage users to keep posting so there's a continuous stream.",20210526-123103
Andy, Of these activities together are forming you know the edge of your own profile this edge rank for yourself as a user and collectively within the platform.,20210526-123103

Andy," You know, and he just said, is it is an edge list edge, so I talked a little bit about Darren Darren here which Karen doesn't want me to mention.",20210526-123103
Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210526-123103
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210526-123103
Andy, And it's and and moving towards that edge is impossible it's an aporia it's and Angeles edge because it represents.,20210526-123103
Andy, A kind of cynic Tokyo kind of representation of ourselves so i'll read otherwise we'll never in this character so users upload that live content social media reconstructing that world they take on a digital persona and step into the map social media provides the APP.,20210526-123103
Andy," profiles sorry social media profiles or the APP replace the territory, and there are users who find comfort in the template driven.",20210526-123103
Andy," surface of the plateau like joey and others who are uncomfortable and resist the urge like Chandler no end on chandler's words when joey steps into the map chandler's kind of horrified by this, and he looks on and says, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it.",20210526-123103
Andy," Matters what a place to invest, well, I think the conclusion, though it yeah definitely about platform ISM but the conclusion that we draw it in the paper that unfortunately we didn't upload in time.",20210526-123103
Andy, Is that what what writing can occur when you're writing with the awareness of the processes of the edge that will allow your work to be seen in a in a particular way and it creates your audience for you.,20210526-123103
Andy, it's not it's not a democratizing space in any in any way your audience is filtered by this edge rank.,20210526-123103
Andy," So what writing can occur when you write with the awareness of the processes of the edge, knowing that the that the activity.",20210526-123103
Andy," Is the data you're transacting, this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service, when you become a user and you enact the platform ISM and then, knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that's I guess the question is, how can we write.",20210526-123103
Andy, In against.,20210526-123103
Andy, The platform yeah.,20210526-123103

Serge BOUCHARDON," So, for her an interactive now it again as ballerina love would be more based on identification than an empathy.",20210526-123103
Serge BOUCHARDON," So, would you agree with that this is my first question and I got the second question.",20210526-123103

susiecronin," yeah Thank you so much, so those are two really great questions and to address the first question this idea of empathy as a hindered or block desire to help the character, I think that's really pertinent to bury me my love and, for me, and there is a point which also makes me think of.",20210526-123103

susiecronin," is something really jarring to both the user and imagine, because the way in which she depict her experience is always extremely jokey.",20210526-123103
susiecronin, it's almost as if she's partaking in this mischievous adventure and there is a point in which that sort of crack in the in the perfect carving of the narrative as something.,20210526-123103
susiecronin, liberating leads the user and magic to question that whole depiction so there's an element in which that flips the whole experience and it shows precisely that blockage to empathy the fact that what we've been consuming.,20210526-123103

susiecronin, him.,20210526-140013

susiecronin, him.,20210526-110200
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210526-110200

susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210526-110200

susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210526-110200

susiecronin, him.,20210525-123443

susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210525-123443
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210525-123443

susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210525-123443

susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210525-123443

Andy, Of these activities together are forming you know the edge of your own profile this edge rank for yourself as a user and collectively within the platform.,20210527-140059

Andy," You know, and he just said, is it is an edge list edge, so I talked a little bit about Darren Darren here which Karen doesn't want me to mention.",20210527-140059
Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210527-140059
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210527-140059
Andy, And it's and and moving towards that edge is impossible it's an aporia it's and Angeles edge because it represents.,20210527-140059
Andy, A kind of cynic Tokyo kind of representation of ourselves so i'll read otherwise we'll never in this character so users upload that live content social media reconstructing that world they take on a digital persona and step into the map social media provides the APP.,20210527-140059

Andy," surface of the plateau like joey and others who are uncomfortable and resist the urge like Chandler no end on chandler's words when joey steps into the map chandler's kind of horrified by this, and he looks on and says, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it.",20210527-140059
Andy," Matters what a place to invest, well, I think the conclusion, though it yeah definitely about platform ISM but the conclusion that we draw it in the paper that unfortunately we didn't upload in time.",20210527-140059
Andy, Is that what what writing can occur when you're writing with the awareness of the processes of the edge that will allow your work to be seen in a in a particular way and it creates your audience for you.,20210527-140059
Andy, it's not it's not a democratizing space in any in any way your audience is filtered by this edge rank.,20210527-140059

Andy," Is the data you're transacting, this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service, when you become a user and you enact the platform ISM and then, knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that's I guess the question is, how can we write.",20210527-140059

Serge BOUCHARDON," So, for her an interactive now it again as ballerina love would be more based on identification than an empathy.",20210527-140059
Serge BOUCHARDON," So, would you agree with that this is my first question and I got the second question.",20210527-140059

susiecronin," yeah Thank you so much, so those are two really great questions and to address the first question this idea of empathy as a hindered or block desire to help the character, I think that's really pertinent to bury me my love and, for me, and there is a point which also makes me think of.",20210527-140059

susiecronin," is something really jarring to both the user and imagine, because the way in which she depict her experience is always extremely jokey.",20210527-140059
susiecronin, it's almost as if she's partaking in this mischievous adventure and there is a point in which that sort of crack in the in the perfect carving of the narrative as something.,20210527-140059
susiecronin, liberating leads the user and magic to question that whole depiction so there's an element in which that flips the whole experience and it shows precisely that blockage to empathy the fact that what we've been consuming.,20210527-140059

Anna Nacher, My question would be Do you see any chance or any rural or significance significance for the gaps in the narrative.,20210527-140059

Andy, bodily moving into the the the the map itself and we started thinking okay well there's something in this here.,20210527-200256

Anna Nacher, My question would be Do you see any chance or any rural or significance significance for the gaps in the narrative.,20210527-200256

susiecronin, Perfect cool Thank you so much.,20210527-200036

susiecronin," Mobility and privilege and travel in the present so as part of that sort of interest strand, this is something that I developed following.",20210527-200036

susiecronin," navigate the job market in Europe, but I think the two Apps that I look at here survival and very me my love both produced in 2017 are interesting for this kind of purity of.",20210527-200036

susiecronin, Engaging user interactivity and they use the game form but in sort of a non traditional way as i'll explore here.,20210527-200036
susiecronin," And so, because of the shortness of the discussion i'm just going to cherry pick some of the points and I was skeptical initially when I read this was my presentation on moving sorry.",20210527-200036
susiecronin, him.,20210527-200036
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210527-200036
susiecronin," persuasive game useful here, so the persuasive game is that is designated as an art practice or a piece of instructive art, more so than a sort of marketable product designed as an enjoyable distraction from the real world.",20210527-200036

susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210527-200036
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210527-200036

susiecronin," describe the six and levels, I was gonna say chapters i've kind of internalize the narrative too much so survival is an APP that's held.",20210527-200036
susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210527-200036
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210527-200036

Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210527-200036

Anna Nacher, My question would be Do you see any chance or any rural or significance significance for the gaps in the narrative.,20210527-200036

susiecronin, him.,20210527-200133
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210527-200133

susiecronin, him.,20210527-200623
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210527-200623

susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210527-200623

susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210527-200623

susiecronin, Perfect cool Thank you so much.,20210527-123049

susiecronin," Mobility and privilege and travel in the present so as part of that sort of interest strand, this is something that I developed following.",20210527-123049

susiecronin, him.,20210527-123049
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210527-123049

susiecronin," And, and so really emphasizes the particular aptitude of the persuasive game forum for dealing with political themes such as Labor migrants and war.",20210527-123049
susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210527-123049
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210527-123049

susiecronin," Of the narratives I explore here are published on phone Apps is really powerful in the sense that it creates this kind of as even as possible access, and let me see.",20210527-123049

susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210527-123049
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210527-123049
susiecronin," fitting in with the game for them, and I think that's part of the fact that it's generated as a collaborative project that I believe did not receive so much funding.",20210527-123049
susiecronin, But they've done very well in order to create a piece that raises awareness that's freely available and that represents what can be done.,20210527-123049

susiecronin," has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the Google play store reads I like it, but why does the boat level have to take so long.",20210527-123049
susiecronin, So I think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly.,20210527-123049
susiecronin," And i'm conscious of time i'm probably a exploiting the time limit, a little bit so do stop me please, and if.",20210527-123049

susiecronin, How you choose to respond you normally have two options so you're you as the user are interacting as magic was no noise husband in the narrative.,20210527-123049
susiecronin," And the tone is very sort of ludic, so I think the title very me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non Arabic speaker but it's sort of colloquialism that is quite a commonplace way of saying goodbye.",20210527-123049
susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210527-123049

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210527-123049

susiecronin, A migratory trajectory.,20210527-123049

susiecronin, him.,20210527-123116

susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210527-123116

susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210527-123116

Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210527-110230
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210527-110230

Andy," Is the data you're transacting, this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service, when you become a user and you enact the platform ISM and then, knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that's I guess the question is, how can we write.",20210527-110230

susiecronin, him.,20210528-105935
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210528-105935

susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210528-105935
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210528-105935

susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210528-105935

susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210528-105935

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210528-105935

susiecronin, I shouldn't try and speak and coordinate myself at the same time can everyone see my screen.,20210528-200537
susiecronin, Perfect cool Thank you so much.,20210528-200537
susiecronin, um yes okay so i'm currently looking at the way in which online communities are formed and the way in which the iterations of Community then have sort of repercussions for understanding of.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," Mobility and privilege and travel in the present so as part of that sort of interest strand, this is something that I developed following.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," Reading the IOM world migration report in 2020 and to see that migrate narratives have been rendered in expressive digital forms, so that is to say.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," narrative forums that operate for the purpose of storytelling so we have instances of Apps, such as the Italian up working, which is a slightly game of fired up that is designed to allow migrants to.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," navigate the job market in Europe, but I think the two Apps that I look at here survival and very me my love both produced in 2017 are interesting for this kind of purity of.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, em storytelling intention and the idea that they're purely for narrative purposes and they're both gamma Phi to they're both sort of designed in such a way that they are.,20210528-200537
susiecronin, Engaging user interactivity and they use the game form but in sort of a non traditional way as i'll explore here.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," And so, because of the shortness of the discussion i'm just going to cherry pick some of the points and I was skeptical initially when I read this was my presentation on moving sorry.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, him.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," persuasive game useful here, so the persuasive game is that is designated as an art practice or a piece of instructive art, more so than a sort of marketable product designed as an enjoyable distraction from the real world.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," And, and so really emphasizes the particular aptitude of the persuasive game forum for dealing with political themes such as Labor migrants and war.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," of migrant centered content and content created and by and four people on the move, as a force that can sort of regenerate and refresh and.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," contribute positively to our perception of what migrant experience is, and I think, as has arisen in sort of previous discussions in different panels.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," The mobile phone kind of keeps arising as one of the most democratic sort of platforms for and the sharing of digital narrative, so I think this fact that both.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," Of the narratives I explore here are published on phone Apps is really powerful in the sense that it creates this kind of as even as possible access, and let me see.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," So i'll skip forward a little bit because i'm conscious of time, this is the homepage of survival, so it shows the sort of six thumbnails that and.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," describe the six and levels, I was gonna say chapters i've kind of internalize the narrative too much so survival is an APP that's held.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210528-200537
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," fitting in with the game for them, and I think that's part of the fact that it's generated as a collaborative project that I believe did not receive so much funding.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, But they've done very well in order to create a piece that raises awareness that's freely available and that represents what can be done.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," When sort of migrant communities and locals in inverted commas, because I think that term is also quite a strangely towards realizing and work together in order to create something that allows people to navigate.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, And I think it was altered in some of the reviews for its simplicity and I think in some ways the way in which it's set up as a game.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the Google play store reads I like it, but why does the boat level have to take so long.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, So I think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," And i'm conscious of time i'm probably a exploiting the time limit, a little bit so do stop me please, and if.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, i'm going over a very me my love is a much more sort of developed project in the sense that there are multiple sort of.,20210528-200537

susiecronin," A sort of clandestine journey and to Turkey, there are a number of different sort of strands of the narrative so depending on.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, How you choose to respond you normally have two options so you're you as the user are interacting as magic was no noise husband in the narrative.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," And the tone is very sort of ludic, so I think the title very me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non Arabic speaker but it's sort of colloquialism that is quite a commonplace way of saying goodbye.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210528-200537
susiecronin," that we need to probe here as well, to what degree, words are being placed in the characters mode what's being lost or gained in translation, but that's a whole nother.",20210528-200537

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210528-200537
susiecronin, And so I think this does work really effectively in order to generate sort of a sense of empathy with someone in the position of being separated from a loved one who's undertaking.,20210528-200537
susiecronin, A migratory trajectory.,20210528-200537

susiecronin, yeah I think it runs just being kind I think i'm probably running over.,20210528-200537

susiecronin, apprehension and the restrictions on her in terms of not allowing her phone battery to die because she's never quite sure.,20210528-200537

susiecronin," i'll skip ahead, just to my concluding remarks because I think I should sort of start to wrap up.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, And then again i've mentioned this before the phone is an intersection between practicality and entertainment urgency and destruction.,20210528-200537
susiecronin," And it kind of operators quite a democratic platform choice, so I think the mobile APP narrative has a huge amount of potential for narratives in terms of diffusing widely and diffusing in a democratic way.",20210528-200537
susiecronin, A return to the persuasive game notion will no doubt pro fruitful in gaining a fuller understanding of the game form beyond lunatics.,20210528-200537

susiecronin, But whether the persuasive game inverts the traditionally held perception of video games form as rooted in fantastical escapism and instead engages the player and urgent immersion and confrontation with real world issues.,20210528-200537
susiecronin, And that's sort of an open ended question that will just sort of feed into further probing of this persuasive game idea in relation to not only migrant narratives but also LGBT Q sort of narratives and the scope of.,20210528-200537

Julian Hanna," there's been a lot of great scholarship on the manifesto, but most of it was written before 2008 so it's starting to get it's you know just in social media was getting started so it's it's getting.",20210528-200537
Julian Hanna," slightly out of date and that's the kind of gap i'm trying to fill, but in this case i'm just starting i'm just focusing really on the pandemic period.",20210528-200537

Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210528-200537
Andy, And it's and and moving towards that edge is impossible it's an aporia it's and Angeles edge because it represents.,20210528-200537

Andy," You know it's better than a just a repost are alike, and then the decay that it's it's how it's like losing visibility, over time, so the idea, this will encourage users to keep posting so there's a continuous stream.",20210528-200015
Andy, Of these activities together are forming you know the edge of your own profile this edge rank for yourself as a user and collectively within the platform.,20210528-200015

Andy," You know, and he just said, is it is an edge list edge, so I talked a little bit about Darren Darren here which Karen doesn't want me to mention.",20210528-200015
Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210528-200015
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210528-200015
Andy, And it's and and moving towards that edge is impossible it's an aporia it's and Angeles edge because it represents.,20210528-200015
Andy, A kind of cynic Tokyo kind of representation of ourselves so i'll read otherwise we'll never in this character so users upload that live content social media reconstructing that world they take on a digital persona and step into the map social media provides the APP.,20210528-200015

Andy," surface of the plateau like joey and others who are uncomfortable and resist the urge like Chandler no end on chandler's words when joey steps into the map chandler's kind of horrified by this, and he looks on and says, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it.",20210528-200015
Andy," Matters what a place to invest, well, I think the conclusion, though it yeah definitely about platform ISM but the conclusion that we draw it in the paper that unfortunately we didn't upload in time.",20210528-200015
Andy, Is that what what writing can occur when you're writing with the awareness of the processes of the edge that will allow your work to be seen in a in a particular way and it creates your audience for you.,20210528-200015
Andy, it's not it's not a democratizing space in any in any way your audience is filtered by this edge rank.,20210528-200015

Andy," Is the data you're transacting, this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service, when you become a user and you enact the platform ISM and then, knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that's I guess the question is, how can we write.",20210528-200015

Serge BOUCHARDON," So, for her an interactive now it again as ballerina love would be more based on identification than an empathy.",20210528-200015
Serge BOUCHARDON," So, would you agree with that this is my first question and I got the second question.",20210528-200015

susiecronin," yeah Thank you so much, so those are two really great questions and to address the first question this idea of empathy as a hindered or block desire to help the character, I think that's really pertinent to bury me my love and, for me, and there is a point which also makes me think of.",20210528-200015

susiecronin," is something really jarring to both the user and imagine, because the way in which she depict her experience is always extremely jokey.",20210528-200015
susiecronin, it's almost as if she's partaking in this mischievous adventure and there is a point in which that sort of crack in the in the perfect carving of the narrative as something.,20210528-200015
susiecronin, liberating leads the user and magic to question that whole depiction so there's an element in which that flips the whole experience and it shows precisely that blockage to empathy the fact that what we've been consuming.,20210528-200015

Anna Nacher, My question would be Do you see any chance or any rural or significance significance for the gaps in the narrative.,20210528-200015

Andy, We we were wondering.,20210528-140017
Andy, about these spaces that were once occupied by individuals and artists and and practitioners.,20210528-140017
Andy, In electronic literature.,20210528-140017
Andy, Becoming eclipsed by social media platforms and we started to think a little bit about what happens.,20210528-140017
Andy," Inside those spaces, when an artist or a writer begins to work in those spaces so we've we started working on the APP is not the territory.",20210528-140017

Andy," You know we're we're sort of writing this research, we started off with the idea of 1000 platforms, so we talked a little bit about platform ISM and we try and establish.",20210528-140017
Andy," Some arguments around platform ISM as an ideology, but we wanted to look at platform ISM as an ideology, because it seems to have.",20210528-140017
Andy, As Andy was saying it's eclipsed the use of the World Wide Web it has taken the audience away obviously well repositioned as as all of the examples we've seen today.,20210528-140017
Andy," In this panel have shown us obviously thriving even in these spaces and we're not denying that at all what we're saying, though, is that perhaps in the rush to occupy and to work within these spaces, there may be.",20210528-140017
Andy," There may not have been enough time to reflect on what the audiences and challenges of platform ISM are like what are we doing inside platform isn't, how is it changing the artist and the and the creative practitioner, so we wanted to establish that platform ISM.",20210528-140017
Andy, platform is we call it platform ISM and we believe very strongly that it is an ideology obviously this is reflecting what echoing.,20210528-140017
Andy," work by loving and Wendy churn and this suggestion has been made, that this is, we are in an ideology when we're in these applications on our smartphones because.",20210528-140017
Andy, There is a certain control ahead Gemini of the structure and of the formal spaces and of the template and there's no no control over the over the writing spaces and the communication spaces by the user and so.,20210528-140017
Andy," And at the same time, we are perceiving our world in a different way, if we are performing or creating within social media with our life activity.",20210528-140017
Andy," So, in the end the platform or the system of platforms through the device and the APP and the other uses controls our perception, it is logical in its form.",20210528-140017
Andy," It controls, our actions or It encouraged us to act in particular ways and, and these are all the signs that point to platform ISM being an ideology, if you frame it in this way, so we.",20210528-140017
Andy," So i'm skipping that page, then we will.",20210528-140017
Andy, say so.,20210528-140017
Andy, So all right so we're talking about we're talking about.,20210528-140017
Andy," An ideology and list let's take that as a premise what we're starting to really think about at this point, and I think a good example of this is a scene from friends the TV series in which.",20210528-140017
Andy," All the characters visit London, and this would be very quick So if you can indulge this example Chandler and and joey exit from the hotel in London and joy is you probably know, the same it's quite well known, but if you don't.",20210528-140017

Andy, The screen that i'm.,20210528-140017
Andy, That we're talking on top of here.,20210528-140017
Andy, And this was a really interesting thing for us it's this Mary poppins moment sort of jumping into kind of drawings on the ground and entering into a new reality we see Joe instead kind of.,20210528-140017
Andy, bodily moving into the the the the map itself and we started thinking okay well there's something in this here.,20210528-140017
Andy," So we talked about, we talked about platforms as literally being like the etymology plateaus you know they are raised up from.",20210528-140017
Andy," Everything else that is the ground or is the flow, or is the Internet or whatever else, and this started, of course, with with the page rank system, you know where webs.",20210528-140017
Andy," web sites have to be seen, so there was the idea of a search engine that would rank or page rank from from brand and page and brands page rank is is basically the the original.",20210528-140017
Andy," That edge, if you like, that later becomes the edge rank that we find in a lot of these platforms so we're drawing a conclusion at this point that the that the platform, the edge of this platform.",20210528-140017
Andy," This edge less edge in a way, is defined by the user and but defined by the multiple users as well, because the the social media application is only as strong as the number of followers as.",20210528-140017
Andy," You know, as was mentioned before, the idea of Gavin parlor and all of these.",20210528-140017
Andy, These Apps they have their followers again subscribing to the ideology of platform ISM but that communal edge is the is determined by the algorithm.,20210528-140017
Andy," Of affinity and weight and decay, so the number of people that you have around you at any given time and the weight, which is the importance of your post, the idea that it is original content or it's.",20210528-140017
Andy," You know it's better than a just a repost are alike, and then the decay that it's it's how it's like losing visibility, over time, so the idea, this will encourage users to keep posting so there's a continuous stream.",20210528-140017
Andy, Of these activities together are forming you know the edge of your own profile this edge rank for yourself as a user and collectively within the platform.,20210528-140017
Andy," But then the edge of that platform, if it is your own activity and you're living that and proceed it, it keeps pushing beyond it's it's as.",20210528-140017
Andy," You know, and he just said, is it is an edge list edge, so I talked a little bit about Darren Darren here which Karen doesn't want me to mention.",20210528-140017
Andy," But let's say that i'm leaning on derrida's notion of aporia so this border beyond which we can't pass, so this so so the platform represents in a way.",20210528-140017
Andy, a map of outdoor territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it.,20210528-140017
Andy, And it's and and moving towards that edge is impossible it's an aporia it's and Angeles edge because it represents.,20210528-140017
Andy, A kind of cynic Tokyo kind of representation of ourselves so i'll read otherwise we'll never in this character so users upload that live content social media reconstructing that world they take on a digital persona and step into the map social media provides the APP.,20210528-140017
Andy," profiles sorry social media profiles or the APP replace the territory, and there are users who find comfort in the template driven.",20210528-140017
Andy," surface of the plateau like joey and others who are uncomfortable and resist the urge like Chandler no end on chandler's words when joey steps into the map chandler's kind of horrified by this, and he looks on and says, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it.",20210528-140017
Andy," Matters what a place to invest, well, I think the conclusion, though it yeah definitely about platform ISM but the conclusion that we draw it in the paper that unfortunately we didn't upload in time.",20210528-140017
Andy, Is that what what writing can occur when you're writing with the awareness of the processes of the edge that will allow your work to be seen in a in a particular way and it creates your audience for you.,20210528-140017
Andy, it's not it's not a democratizing space in any in any way your audience is filtered by this edge rank.,20210528-140017
Andy," So what writing can occur when you write with the awareness of the processes of the edge, knowing that the that the activity.",20210528-140017
Andy," Is the data you're transacting, this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service, when you become a user and you enact the platform ISM and then, knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that's I guess the question is, how can we write.",20210528-140017
Andy, In against.,20210528-140017
Andy, The platform yeah.,20210528-140017

Anne Karhio," Which is a valid approach, but equally valid is the question of who controls platform platforms, who controls their design who decides what we see who sees our.",20210528-140017

Serge BOUCHARDON," There is a French natural just for service now nurture and she defines empathy in a fiction, as the and we say it in French, because I know you can speak French Medusa obviously depending on the persona dependencies from one.",20210528-140017
Serge BOUCHARDON," So, for her an interactive now it again as ballerina love would be more based on identification than an empathy.",20210528-140017
Serge BOUCHARDON," So, would you agree with that this is my first question and I got the second question.",20210528-140017
Serge BOUCHARDON," I think it's interesting to notice that the inspiration of Bernie my love originally on time on the move, in France.",20210528-140017
Serge BOUCHARDON," was a real what's up thread published by a limo the newspaper, but the website reminder site.",20210528-140017
Serge BOUCHARDON, It was called the diary of an immigrant and then it was transformed in a in a fiction for smartphone Mr Fisher.,20210528-140017

Serge BOUCHARDON, accelerates the blurring of the fiction gaseous reality frontier distinction.,20210528-140017
susiecronin," yeah Thank you so much, so those are two really great questions and to address the first question this idea of empathy as a hindered or block desire to help the character, I think that's really pertinent to bury me my love and, for me, and there is a point which also makes me think of.",20210528-140017
susiecronin," Some years presentation in which the female writers referred to catharsis and emancipation because there's a point and bury me my love, in which nor admits that she is tired of the abuse that she's been suffering and this.",20210528-140017
susiecronin," is something really jarring to both the user and imagine, because the way in which she depict her experience is always extremely jokey.",20210528-140017
susiecronin, it's almost as if she's partaking in this mischievous adventure and there is a point in which that sort of crack in the in the perfect carving of the narrative as something.,20210528-140017
susiecronin, liberating leads the user and magic to question that whole depiction so there's an element in which that flips the whole experience and it shows precisely that blockage to empathy the fact that what we've been consuming.,20210528-140017
susiecronin," is produced, specifically for our consumption and not as a realistic depiction of personal experience, so I think that experience of empathy as a frustrated and impossible identification is probably and.",20210528-140017
susiecronin," engendered by that one sort of pivotal point, so I think that's quite interesting and the second question, let me just have a little look.",20210528-140017
susiecronin," Oh no i've lost it, it was real what's up a do you think the smartphone device reinforces the blurring of the fiction is reality frontier absolutely because.",20210528-140017

Anna Nacher, My question would be Do you see any chance or any rural or significance significance for the gaps in the narrative.,20210528-140017

Anna Nacher," it's because your your presentation was so so inspiring so so that would be my question, do you see any any chance in the potential or any examples of such gaps discontinuities that would actually be you know, for me, that would be the potential to and pathetic storylines.",20210528-140017
susiecronin, yeah thanks that's really great and I absolutely think that so linkedin a little bit to what we were saying with surge.,20210528-140017

susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210528-123004

susiecronin, him.,20210528-110050
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210528-110050

susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210528-110050

susiecronin, Perfect cool Thank you so much.,20210528-110010

susiecronin, him.,20210528-110010
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210528-110010

susiecronin," And, and so really emphasizes the particular aptitude of the persuasive game forum for dealing with political themes such as Labor migrants and war.",20210528-110010
susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210528-110010
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210528-110010

susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210528-110010
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210528-110010
susiecronin," fitting in with the game for them, and I think that's part of the fact that it's generated as a collaborative project that I believe did not receive so much funding.",20210528-110010

susiecronin," has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the Google play store reads I like it, but why does the boat level have to take so long.",20210528-110010
susiecronin, So I think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly.,20210528-110010
susiecronin," And i'm conscious of time i'm probably a exploiting the time limit, a little bit so do stop me please, and if.",20210528-110010

susiecronin," And the tone is very sort of ludic, so I think the title very me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non Arabic speaker but it's sort of colloquialism that is quite a commonplace way of saying goodbye.",20210528-110010
susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210528-110010

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210528-110010

susiecronin, him.,20210528-180350
susiecronin," There we go now apologies, so I was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that's how survival presents itself on its Google APP store homepage and then I found the concept of retirees and.",20210528-180350

susiecronin, And so I found this quite a constructor sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material.,20210528-180350
susiecronin," And I looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we want kind of have time to look into other platforms, such as instagram, for example, but I think it's interesting to look at the capacity.",20210528-180350

susiecronin, In landscape rotation on the phone so it's kind of read the lens of this kind of game boy.,20210528-180350
susiecronin, format and the gamification does mean that the APP simplifies somewhat the kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate empathy is kind of surrendered a little bit to.,20210528-180350
susiecronin," fitting in with the game for them, and I think that's part of the fact that it's generated as a collaborative project that I believe did not receive so much funding.",20210528-180350

susiecronin," has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the Google play store reads I like it, but why does the boat level have to take so long.",20210528-180350
susiecronin, So I think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly.,20210528-180350
susiecronin," And i'm conscious of time i'm probably a exploiting the time limit, a little bit so do stop me please, and if.",20210528-180350

susiecronin," And the tone is very sort of ludic, so I think the title very me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non Arabic speaker but it's sort of colloquialism that is quite a commonplace way of saying goodbye.",20210528-180350
susiecronin," So I think, and then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and, in some ways, quite American, so there is a little sense and.",20210528-180350

susiecronin, The way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there's a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays.,20210528-180350
