Abstract 
This paper explores work by Australian net.artist and game designer Mez Breeze. In 2020, 
Breeze’s VR and XR creations were shortlisted for the Woollahra Digital Literary Award. 
In 2019 she won Queensland University of Technology’s Digital Literature Award for 
her  Virtual  Reality  Microstories  Series  V[R]ignettes,  and  received  the  Marjorie  C. 
Luesebrink Career Achievement Award as a visionary artist. In 2018, another of her VR 
Literature experiences was shortlisted for the If:book New Media Writing Prize. Also in 
2018, Mez Breeze collaborated with Microsoft, Samsung and MasterpieceVR in their VR 
Influencers  Sustainability  Initiative.  These  are  only  some  of  her  achievements.  She 
currently  serves  as  an  Advisor  to  the  Mixed  Augmented  Reality  Art  Research 
Organisation  and  is  a  Senior  Research  Affiliate  of  the  Humanities  and  Critical  Code 
Studies Lab, among other responsibilities.  

V[R]erses is a collection of 3D online experiences of X-Reality -virtual, mixed, 
and  augmented-  created  by  Mez  Breeze  in  collaboration  with  other  well-known  E-lit 
artists. In this paper, I argue that this work inquiries into the posthuman scenario, that is, 
on the impact of human and nonhuman actions in the Anthropocene.  

In the case of electronic literature and net.art, a central concern has been the role 
of software, considered by some a sort of disembodied haunting voice of the ghost in the 
machine. In “Theory as Praxis: The poetics of Electronic Textuality” (2002), Johanna 
Drucker, turned to Jerome McGann’s Radiant Textuality to assert that the Aristotelian’s 
concept of “poïesis”, nowadays conceptualized only as theory was, in its ancient Greek 
original meaning, a form of making or craft (see also López-Varela 2017). According to 
Drucker, “Making things … pushes the horizons of one’s understanding.” (2002: 684) 
Decades later, there is still the need to call attention to the practical aspects of Humanities 
disciplines. The aims of this paper are multiple. It attempts to show how art and, in this 
case,  Mez  Breeze’s  net.art,  foregrounds  contemporary  problems  such  as  the  possible 
agency of nonhuman actants. It also calls for a blend of STEM disciplines into STE[A]M 
in order to highlight the 4E1 consilience of all knowledge.

Human Readable Messages and nonhuman intra-actions 
In 2011, Mez Breeze published a book entitled Human Readable Messages [mezangelle 
2003 - 2011]. On the back-cover of her volume, she poses the following question to the 
readers: 
 

Q: wot do u get if u stitch 2gether standardized literary conventions [think: the 
monumental  output  of  bill  Shakespeare  +  the  staccato  pulsings  of  Emily 
Dickinson] with coded poetics steeped in digitally-drenched communication?  

 
This is her description of mezangelle, a type of codework she developed in the 1990s and 
which she used to write her book in diary form. mezangelle, which Breeze spells without 
capitals, is a new form of writing that combines English language with some code features

of programming languages such as ASCII code, fragments of markup language, protocol 
code, and others. Her choice of denomination echoes not only her own name but also the 
musical pieces known as villanelle.2 For readers who cannot interpret code features, the 
simple bracketing of letters within words enables the emergence of multiple meanings. 
The  result  is  similar  to  the  portmanteau  words  used  by  Lewis  Carroll  in  his  poem 
“Jabberwocky”.3 Other authors, such as James Joyce in his novel Finnegans Wake, or 
William Burrough’s cut/ups are examples of a struggle to break down the linearity of 
alphabetic writing (López-Varela 2014).  

Her  poem  “Anthropo[S]ceney||AnthropO[bs]cene”,  which  appeared  in  2015  in 
netwurker.livejournal.com,  is an example of mezangelle mostly made up of bracketing. 
The poem is a meditation on the Anthropocene, a term that has come to signify our current 
age in geological time, marked by the beginning of humanity's effects on the environment 
on a global scale. Coined by chemist Paul J. Crutzen and marine biologist Eugene F. 
Stoermer, the term emphasises human impact on the planet, characterized by encounters 
with nonhuman agents. Thus, it considers the material inter-actions and intra-actions that 
occur between organisms and their environments. In the Anthropocene, the need arises to 
consider forms of intentionality that come from nonhuman entities. The category of the 
nonhuman includes biological forms -animal, plants, microorganisms-, as well as non-
biological entities such as machines and forthcoming forms of AI. 

In his essay “Finding and Evaluating the Code,” David Shepard divides code into 
different layers in digital work: the executed layer, structural layers and the source code, 
all of which contribute in meaning making. In “Deeper into the Machine: Learning to 
Speak Digital,” (2002) Hayles mentions Mez Breeze as member of a new generation of 
artists  who  produce  works  where  natural  language  mingles  with  the  language  of  the 
machine producing a creole comprised of English and computer code. For Hayles, this 
new trend is “not content to let code remain below the surface but rather [its purpose is 
to]  show  it  erupting  through  the  surface  of  the  screen  to  challenge  the  hegemony  of 
alphabetic language.” (Hayles 2002: 372) 

Indeed,  Breeze’s  mezangelle  recombinations  contribute  to  the  emergence  of  a 
multiplicity of meanings that create an effect of “defamiliarization”.4 This mechanism, 
introduced  in  1917  by  Russian  formalist  Viktor  Shklovsky  in  his  essay  “Art  as 
Technique”, sought to explore the phonetic and lexical structure of a given distribution 
of words in order to find material to remove the automatism of perception and cognition. 
Shklovsky  considered  that  works  of  art  should  modify  perception  in  order  to  raise 
cognitive awareness to how knowledge is produced by means of language.   

Codework is reminiscent of other techniques used to subvert power structures and 
their alphabetic language vehicle. We have already mentioned Lewis Carroll and James 
                                                           
2  Villanelle were forms of light Italian secular vocal music originating in Naples around 1550. The subject 
matter was generally rustic, comic, satirical and parodic. It was a polifonic genre,  performed by two or 
more unaccompanied voices singing in combination and with equal importance. Short phrases were taken 
up by the voices one after another in fugal imitation; after two or three repetitions of a phrase, the succeeding 
one was introduced, commonly overlapping or displacing the previous.  
3  mezangelle  blends  human  discourse  with  machine  code  in  a  form  that  resembles  Lewis  Carroll’s 
“portmanteau”  words.  The  term  referred  to  a  travelling  suitcase  that  opened  into  two  equal  sections. 
Breeze’s  bracketed  blends  physically  resemble  the  carrying  handles  of  such  suitcase.  The  meaning  of 
mezangelle ‘travels’ in the sense that it is fugitive. Its form enables a multitude of meanings emerging from 
a broken word. mezangelle is also often satirical, calling attention to issues that need pressing solutions.  
4 Defamiliarization, in Russian “Ostranenie”, was the technique of presenting to audiences common things 
in an unfamiliar or strange way so they could gain new perspectives and see the world differently. The 
techique has deeply influenced 20th-century art and theory, from Dada to culture jamming. The relationship 
with Sigmund Freud‘s notion of “the uncanny” is also explored in Breeze‘s creations; particularly in her 
V[R]erses.

Joyce’s  portmanteau  words.  In  his  essay  “The  Electronic  Revolution”,  William 
Burroughs imagines language as a virus, spreading by means of institutionalized means 
and hegemonic structures. His cut/ups were conceived as a form of breaking the “order 
of things”, in Michel Foucault’s words. To use post-pandemic terms, mezangelle can be 
seen  as  an  inoculation  of  a  small  portion  of  “pharmakon”  (Derrida  1981:  63-171),  a 
vaccine or antidote (but also a poison) that “incorporates” political antigens in order to 
subvert the infection of power. Roberto Simanowski writes that code is “an indispensable 
element in every discussion of digital arts because everything happening on the screen or 
on the scene is first and foremost subject to the grammar and politics of code.” (2011: 
viii) 

levels,  mobilizing, 

The  introduction  of  codework  in  the  poem  produces  a  virus-like  infection  at 
various 
the 
epistemological. The poem recalls encounters in the Anthropocene, where humans meet 
nonhuman  agents  whose  “intra-actions”,  signalled  by  mark-up  language,  indicate  a 
condition  in  which  none  of  the  actants  pre-exists  their  relationship,  in  a  sort  of 
[multi]verse process ontology. 

the  ontological  and 

in  poïesis, 

the  aesthetic, 

In  Meeting  the  Universe  Halfway  (2007),  quantum  physicist  Karen  Barad 
proposed the concept of "intra-action" to explain that “relata do not preexist relations; 
rather, relata- within-phenomena emerge through specific intra-actions” (2007: 334). She 
adds that phenomena should be understood as “a matter of intra-acting; it is an enactment, 
not something that someone or something has.” (2007: 235) Barad describes her “agential 
realist account” as one where discursive practices are “not human-based activities but 
rather specific material (re)configurings of the world through which local determinations 
of boundaries, properties, and meanings are differentially enacted” (2003: 828). In her 
account, “matter is substance in its intra-active becoming—not a thing but a doing, a 
congealing of agency. And performativity is […] iterative intra-activity.” (2003: 828). 
Furthermore,  for  Barad,  agency  is  a  distributed  condition  where  we  are  not  outside 
observing the world. “Nor are we simply located at particular places in the world; rather, 
we  are  part  of  the  world  in  its  ongoing  intra-activity”  (2003:  828,  emphasis  in  the 
original). In this way, Mez Breeze’s works can be seen as performing a reflection on how 
code  disrupts  the  so-called  ‘natural’  human  language,  forcing  an  inquiry  into  the 
possibility of machine agency; an agency that depends both on machine languages and 
on the materiality of the platforms used to support language inter-intra-actions.  
 
Enaction and Material Engagement Theory 
Before moving on to explore Breeze’s V[R]erses, I would like to provide a brief insight 
into the theories that have expanded the notion  of “[en]action”. As stated before, my 
argument in this paper is that theory (explanation) and performance are but two sides of 
poïesis.  

The term “enaction” was first introduced by Humberto Maturana and Francisco 
Varela in their ground-breaking volume The tree of knowledge: the biological roots of 
human  understanding  (1984).  To  these  authors,  enact  means  to  bring  forth,  a  notion 
connected to their theory of “autopoiesis”. Biological systems are “autopoietic”, meaning 
that they are proactive, self-organizing and self-regulating in particular spatiotemporal 
spans. The term “enaction” seems to be a blend of “enabling/emergent” + “action”.  To 
Maturana  and  Varela,  inter-intra-actions  can  bring  forth  forms  of  meaning  making 
between organisms and their environment (see also Hoffmeyer in López-Varela 2012: 
115-119).  More  recently,  enactivism  has  become  part  of  a  cluster  of  related  theories 
known as the 4Es, which include Embodiment, Embedding, Enaction and, more recently, 

 

3 

the Extended Mind Hypothesis. In relation to encounters in the Anthropocene, the authors 
of The Embodied Mind explain that 

 
The key point, then, is that the species brings forth and specifies its own domain 
of problems ...this domain does not exist "out there" in an environment that acts 
as a landing pad for organisms that somehow drop or parachute into the world. 
Instead,  living  beings  and  their  environments  stand  in  relation  to  each  other 
through mutual specification or codetermination. (Varela, Thompson and Rosch 
1992: 198-199) 
 
In its most recent versions, the Extended Mind (Clark and Chalmers 1998) and 
Material Engagement Theory MET (Malafouris 2013), enactivism  emphasizes material 
agency from a non-anthropocentric point of view, opening the way to nonhuman actions. 
Their arguments is that artefacts are integral to the development of the human mind, and 
that active engagement with material things/signs brings forth meaning making, that is, 
semiotic  activity.  Form  and  meaning  emerge  simultaneously  through  coupling 
mechanisms with the environment, “a sort of visual code or language and thus invites 
reading” (Malafouris 2007: 293).  

 
The functional anatomy of the human mind (which includes the whole organism, 
that  is,  brain/CNS  and  body)  is  a  dynamic  bio-cultural  construct  subject  to 
continuous  ontogenetic  and  phylogenetic  transformation  by  behaviourally 
important and socially embedded experiences. These experiences are mediated 
and sometimes constituted by the use of material objects and artefacts (e.g., the 
blind man’s stick) which for that reason should be seen as continuous, integral, 
and active parts of the human cognitive architecture.( Malafouris 2013: 244) 

 
What can these theories bring to the study of electronic literature and net.art? Which are 
the forms of agency that need to be recognized in the posthuman Anthropocene scenario? 
 
From the Holodeck to Mez Breeze’s V[R]erses5 
The  Holodeck  is  a  fictional  device  from  the  television  series  Star  Trek.  It  was  first 
introduced in an episode called “The Practical Joker”, which brings interesting hermetic 
associations I cannot include in this paper (perhaps just a quick reminder that Hermes is 
the messenger of the gods, s[he] who brings information). Holography was possibly the 
first step towards Virtual Reality. The introduction of multidimensional spatiotemporal 
contexts enabled by the Holodeck platform allowed Star Trek protagonists to question 
their  self-awareness  and  existence,  posing  metaphysical  questions  as  to  the  nature  of 
reality. Lewis Carroll performed a similar inquiry in his Alice books; in particular through 
his exploration of one of the earliest forms of optical platform: the looking-glass (see 
López-Varela 2019). Breeze’s V[R]erses allow a reflection on how we look at the world 
through our screens, which are also optical objects. If mezangelle “inscribes” (in Hayles’ 
terms) human and machine languages in emergent forms of enaction, enabling a multitude 
of voices, the “incorporation” of 3D images in Breeze’s latest creations adds layers of 
semiotic inter-intra-actions.  

V[R]erses are ambiguously described by their author both as a sequence of video-
poems and as micro-stories. Each V[R]erse is what Breeze calls a ‘storybox’ that can be

experienced in 3D in any WebXR device. Indeed, each V[R]erse is a Pandora box that 
enables unexpected [en]actions. The original ancient Greek term for the container was 
pithos, a large jar used for storage of food supplies but also used ritually as a burial urn. 
The term is related to pathos (grief), for opening the box liberated the spirits who created 
great suffering and distress for humans. However, opening Pandora box came to signify 
that  making  mistakes  and  overcoming  difficulties  was  the  only  way  to  become  wise. 
However,  as  in  Eve’s  biblical  story,  the  key  element  of  Pandora’s  narrative  was 
establishing who was to blame. In other words, with whom lies the responsibility for the 
actions? Breeze’s storyboxes inquire into the relocation of the blame and responsibility 
to the reader/user. Thus, remediating the social (Biggs) and engaging the audience into 
our global problems.  

V[R]erses, which first appeared in 2020, offers a “verbovicovisual” experience, 
to use James Joyce’s terms, enhanced with the inclusion of 3D images that “incorporate” 
text  nodes.  These  nodes  open  up  the  different  micro-stories,  and  require  direct 
manipulation by the reader/user in order to reconfigure the sequence in a given direction. 
However, their numbering helps the reader build the first sequence, which [s]he can later 
alter. Almost like an Artificial Neural Network, the nodes seem to be organized in a sort 
of directed acyclic graph where each input creates an adjustment. Interestingly, the nodes 
occupy the entire body of the nonhuman entities under display, signalling the semiotic 
embodying of language and communication. In ANN systems, layers ‘talk’ to one another 
until the ‘output’ layer is reached, serving as the network’s ‘answer’. This is what happens 
in each of Breeze’s story-boxes. 

A recent review in ‘neural’6 online journal describes V[R]erses as “virtual objects 
of literature”. They are exactly that, skeletal objects that ooze lines from their joints. They 
include  hybrid  human-nonhuman  entities,  cyborgs,  human-animal-plant  hybrids, 
mythological beings like dragons, or alien and ghostly creatures from other dimensions. 
The reading experience re-embodies these entities when they are manipulated in three-
dimensional space. This manipulation in space offers a glimpse to life in other planes of 
existence. Each story-box is also packed with intriguing sonic backgrounds. 

At the moment there are thirteen 3D video-pieces with micro-stories authored by 
well-known E-Lit artists. Like the Holodeck in Start Trek, all the video-stories explore 
different aspects of the self, contemplating a sort of metamorphous [multi]verse where 
the famous statement by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is embodied:  “We are not human 
beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.” 
In a few words dedicated to each piece, I try to explain what it has meant for me.

PostHuman Agency 
One  of  the  characteristics  of  online  E-Lit  is  the  fact  that  it  incorporates  greater 
possibilities for interactivity. Audience participation serves to illustrate how agency is the 
emergent product of semiotic enactivism. Material Engagement Theory considers that 
things operate as signs and that “meaning is not the product of representation but the 
product of a process of conceptual integration between conceptual and material domains.” 
(Malafouris 2013: 90) Thus, MET can be seen as an attempt to decouple agency from 
human consciousness and to modulate intentionality toward the nonhuman. I have used 
Mez Breeze’s creations as an example that shows that things, inscribed and embodied,  
are not inert matter. They have the power to affect others and to be affected by them. The 
power to “remediate the social” (Biggs 2012). 

Breeze’s  V[R]erses  highlight  agency  beyond  the  human  in  many  ways;  for 
instance, by means of her disquieting hybrid bio-mechanical figures. The micro-stories 
that accompany them also question human sense of Self.  In her 1999 book, How  We 
Became Posthuman, N. Katherine Hayles traced the different waves of cybernetics and 
explained  that  the  ‘posthuman’  is  made  up  of  various  forms  of  “embodiment”  and 
“inscription”.  Breeze’s  V[R]erses  enable  these  new  forms,  where  materiality  is  not 
relegated to a second order of things. Hayles’ “flickering signifiers characterized by their 
tendency  toward  unexpected  metamorphoses,  attenuations,  and  dispersions”  (“Virtual 
Bodies  and  Flickering  Signifiers,”  76)  become  XR  in  Breeze’s  V[R]erses.  Storybox-
spaces where the signifier “exists as a flexible chain of markers bound together by the 
arbitrary relations specified by the relevant codes […] a signifier on one level becomes a 
signified on the next higher level” (Ibid. 77), the  “symbolic moment when the human 
confronts the posthuman.” (Ibid. 79) 

John  Cayley  (2002)  emphasizes  that  the  encounter  of  languages  ‘enacts’  an 
unstable semiotic form that it is not merely a chain of signifiers ending up in unveiling 
code as text. Codework, a term used for the first time by Alan Sondheim in 2001, was 
described by Talan Memmott as an “anti-genre”. For Cayley, “code is not necessarily 
transparent or visible in human-readable language” but if “read primarily as the language 
displayed on a screen then its address is simplified. It is addressed to a human reader who 

 

6 

is implicitly asked to assimilate the code as part of natural language.” He concludes that 
“The Code Is Not the Text (Unless It Is the Text),” as it happens in Breeze’s mezangelle. 
Cayley also highlights the double political and aesthetic intent in codework creations, 
making visible the agencies of inscription performed by the machine and showing the 
“deep remixability (Manovich 2013: 46) and “dynamic heterarchy” (Hayles 2008: 47 of 
the couplings between the biological and the technological.  

Roy Ascott was prophetic when he forecasted the future of art as a synthesis of 
different art forms, a Gesamtdatenwerk (‘the integrated data work’) which emulates the 
19thcentury concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk. “While it is concerned with both technology 
and  poetry,  the  virtual  and  the  immaterial  as  well  as  the  palpable  and  concrete,  the 
telematic may be categorized as neither art nor science, while being allied in many ways 
to the discourses of both.” (Ascott 1990: 241; emphasis added)   

Indeed, Mez Breeze’s V[R]erses exemplify the new multidirectional STE[A]M 
“topologies of knowledge” (Braidotti 2013: 165) that emerge with the posthuman. Her 
micro-stories question “one’s locations in terms of both space (geo-political or ecological 
dimension)  and  time  (historical  and  genealogical  dimension)”  (Braidotti  2013:  164). 
Concrete  examples  are,  for  instance,  +V[R]erse  1:  “Antelooper”,  in  +V[R]erse  2: 
“Vinity”, in +V[R]erse 5: “Curve”, or in +V[R]erse 8: “The Touch”; all of which stress 
“the limited nature of all claims to knowledge” (Braidotti 2013: 164). 

Reporting  on  Transmediale  2017,  Berlin’s  festival  for  art  and  digital  culture, 
Benjamin Busch asks the question: ‘Does agency lie in the human, the machine, or the 
mediation in between? He goes on to define machine agency in two ways: “a negative 
freedom-from (a refusal of things as they are) and a positive freedom-to (a refusal and 
simultaneously future-building project)” (2017: n.p.). Freedom and resistance are related 
to will and agency, a topic that many of Breeze’s V[R]erses also pick up (see for instance, 
+V[R]erse  3:  “Bracement”,  +V[R]erse  9:  “Formu[E]lation”  or  +V[R]erse  11: 
“[Power_B]Ar[k]cing”) 

The Anthropocene shows the impact nonhuman agency upon human lives. This 
includes  the  kind  of  Vibrant  Matter,  Jane  Bennett  has  in  mind,  where  things  have 
“propensities, or tendencies of their own” (2010: viii). And also the couplings that Stacy 
Alaimo describes as “transcorporeality” in Bodily Natures (2010).  Both concepts are 
much alive in Breeze’s V[R]erses.  
 
Coda 
This paper has focused on work by Australian net.artist Mez Breeze, briefly exploring her 
collection  of  poems/micro-stories  entitled  V[R]erses.  I  have  argued  that  her  use  of 
mezangelle and mixed XR produces new forms of agency materialisation that contribute 
to make visible the emergence of nonhuman actants in the Anthropocene, enabling also 
an  inquiry  into  the  newly  emerging  multidimensional  topologies  of  knowledge.  In 
Breeze’s creations, the languages of the machine emerge as an expression of agency. In 
V[R]erses, this inquiry is directed towards different forms of symbiosis enacted from the 
encounters or couplings between the human and the nonhuman.
