Platform Constructs And Imaginaries: On the making of The Key To Time, a work for 360 
degree cinema, VR, domes and CAVEs. 
Roderick Coover 
 
Introduction 

This paper discusses ways that concepts of time, space and narrative in The Key To Time 
https://unknownterritories.org/keytotime/ and the short musical extract Meet Me At The Station 
are  expressed  through  a  mixing  of  technologies.  Particular  attention  given  to  the  impact  of 
differing platforms upon language, story, genre and user experience.

The Key To Time is a surreal and lyrical work for group immersive environments such as 
 
domes (Figure 12) and 360 degree cinemas as well as for individual viewing on head-mounted 
virtual reality head-mounted displays (VR HMDs). Bridging 1920's silent film and virtual reality, 
the surface story draws viewers into a playful exploration of genre, identity and desire. In doing 
so, the work unravels narrative underpinnings of myths, genres, and technological constructs of 
time.  

 
Created as a collaboration between media artist/filmmaker Roderick Coover (FR/US) and 
composer Krzysztof Wołek (PL), The Key To Time was part of a program designed to build cross-
cultural, composer-artist collaborations. The dreamlike story follows a scientist who is trapped in 
the future due to a time-travel experiment gone wrong. His only hope to escape his predicament 
is to travel through dreams. His dreams, however, are troubled by anxieties, fears and anger. As 
the scientist travels through time, aesthetics shift from those of silent film of the early 20th 
century to those of VR and a future cinema. There is also slippage between these times periods 
and their technologically determined forms of presentation. For example, figures from black and 
white  memories  walk  into  color  settings  as  black  and  white  figures  or  cartoon  ones.  Visual 
references reframe iconic images of early cinematic works like Louis Lumiere's Arrival of a Train 
at Ciotat (1895) and Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) using temporal and perspectival distortions.

The  Key  To  Time  is  one  of  three  projects  sponsored  by  the  IAM  Mickiewicz  Institute 
 
project +100: Three Works That Envision The Emerging Avant-Garde, which was designed to bring 
together artists and composers from differing countries who were working on the cutting edge 
of  art,  sound  and  technology.  Marek  Chołoniewski  (PL)  and  Chris  Cutler  (UK)  created  music 

performances in which brain activity of the performers, registered live through EEG sensors, is 
projected as a virtual model of a floating brain in a collage of graphic forms, photos, videos and 
microscopic  scans  of  tissues,  including  human  tissues.  Piotr  Wyrzykowski  (PL)  and  Echo  Ho's 
(DE/CN)  project  Temporary  Nation  turned  smartphones  into  sound-  and  light-emitting 
instruments; using phones, audience members become participants in a collectively-generated 
performance. In The Key To Time, cinematic production in VR combines with electronic sound 
composition and algorithmic methods of creative production.

The action for Th Key To Time was filmed at the Audio Visual Technology Center (CeTA) in 
Wroclaw, which stands on the site of the historic film studio, Wroclaw Feature Film Studio. A 
major center of vanguard film production in Poland, Wroclaw Feature Film Studio was home to 
the  production  of  works  such  as  Wojciech  Jerzy  Has'  Saragossa  Manuscript  (1964),  Andrzej 
Wajda's Ashes and Diamonds (1958) and Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water (1962). In 2011, 
the studios were revitalized as the Audiovisual Technology Center. The center covers over 8500 
square meters of space including the largest universal greenbox studio in Poland with the surface 

of 330 square meters as well as an impressive bluebox studio. The history of the studio as well as 
the production conditions made it ideal for this project about cinema and its evolving forms.  
 
Platform Creation 

The images are created using a range of technologies with live-action super-imposed on 
natural and created settings. Many of the settings and many images used in montage sequences 
were filmed using the 8K 3D 360 degree Instapro VR camera and others 4K VR images were filmed 
using the waterproof Garmin Virb. Virtual settings were created on computer using the open 
source 3D creation Blender, and most of the live-action occurs in the Blender-created settings. 
The live-action  filmed in the green studio  was filmed using 4k Sony FS7 video cameras. Two 
cameras were aligned side by side to create 3D images to be superimposed upon the settings. 
Images recorded using panoramic photography devices were adapted and animated. Many other 
images were created from non-VR imagery using post-production tools and animation.  

Figure 4. Travel through a wormhole. 

 
Images  filmed  and  photographed  on  digital  single-lens  reflex  cameras  (DSLRS)  were 
geometrically  contorted  to  be  recognizable  as  components  in  equirectangular  images  that 

 

contain a full 360 degree data in a 2:1 ratio flat image. Post-production software was used not 
only to create, alter, blend, animate and edit these images, but also to introduce perspectival 
distortions that might illuminate ways differing technologies like video and VR construct time and 
space.  

Each of the technologies shaped how the work was imagined and made. For example, 
Blender’s design elements led us to veer toward aesthetics of animation and graphic novel for 
several of the action scenes which then encouraged the introduction of other graphic elements 
such as on screen text and heightened color contrasts. As the Instapro 8k camera proved to be 
poor in low light setting and at distance, shots using that camera needed to be quite close, while 
other VR image was therefore mostly created though the distortion layering and composition of 
non-VR materials using a VR perspectival mesh.

Creators  and  body  actors  met  at  TR  Theater  to  rehearse  in  Warsaw,  Poland,  then 
convened  in  Wroclaw,  Poland,  to  film  in  the  CeTA  green  studios  during  a  6  day  period.  The 
director, composer and voice-over actor participated in live recording sessions using Skype, with 
the actual audio being recorded primarily in Louisville, Kentucky. Post-production then entailed 

 

considerable moving back and forth between PC and Mac, with blender based imagery being 
rendered on Amiga computers and much of the project being compiled on Mac with After Effects. 
Due  to  the  long  renders  required  for  8k  3D  images,  often  several  computers  were  in  use 
simultaneously.  The  use  of  pre-renders  (as  well  as  proxies)  were  essential  in  maintaining 
workflow.

production in the CeTA greenbox studio. Green tape on the floor indicates doorways, passages, 
or objects. Each must be calibrated to the choice of lens and camera placement based on initial 
designs. 

 

 
The choice of presentations platforms also shaped production choices. The more visually 
detailed, longer-length work, which relies on a minimum 8K 3D resolution (7680px x 7680px) was 
best suited for large-scale settings like, 360 cinema and dome settings. Different versions with 
some perspectival shifts and simplification of graphics were designed for VR HMDs. For example, 
some of the soft dissolves and light-play we were trying in 8k 3D format simply didn't provide the 
same  effect  in  VR  for  example  and  this  altered  choices  in  how  such  imagery  or  substitute 
materials might connect to the sound and narrative. The dream-like narrative allowed for such 

substitutions and perhaps at times even benefited from them in the context of the new versions 
that were created.  
As an art project created on a micro-budget, The Key To Time relied on collaborations and 
 
innovation to make the most of the exciting technological opportunities of the emerging media 
forms we were using and of the facilities at CeTA without the costs normally associated with 
studio-based film production. This was achieved through partnerships with CeTA, TR Theater and 
others, the participation of students and interns, other kinds of support from Temple University 
and Louisville University, and a creative approach that embraced the limitations by emphasizing 
fragmentation,  ruptures,  aesthetic  contrasts,  and  shifts  in  representational  forms.  The  work 
includes  performances  by  Joanna  Freszel,  Emily  Albrink,  Katherine  Calcamuggio,  Chad  Sloan, 
Jesse Donner, Natalia Kalita and Paweł Smagała.

actively  layered  upon  a  working  model  of  the  space.  The  conditions  of  product  lead  to  a 
separation of action and setting – of time and place. The model for the setting will later be 
designed  and  textured.  The  model  also  leads  one  to  explore  how  action  elements  can  be 
transposed onto differing settings or transformed through manipulations of speed, color, etc. 

 

Sound-image Design And Production 

Whereas  in  many  films,  sound  composition  comes  after  the  film  is  written,  shot  and 
edited, in this case the music was part of the process of invention rather than an afterthought. 
The audio recording of the script preceded the action filming, which is a workflow more common 
in animation, while the action-sequences were filmed without sound. This decision, which suited 
the platforms were working with, allowed for lots of play between dialog, images and sounds and 
propelled us to making connections between silent or nonsync-sound film and radio drama. It 
also was prudent in removing limitations and costs that would be doing sound recording in the 
green  box  studio,  as  using  microphone  in  360  degree  filming  posing  numerous  practical 
problems.  

The separation of sound and image adds to the surreality, allow for differing kinds of word 
play and interiority. The surreal structure and narrative changes are driven by emotion, impulse 
and concealed themes. Music is effective in evoking these impulses. Five songs were at the center 
of design and in some cases, script elements were built around them in a fragmentary form after 
which processes of layering and interconnection took place.  

Several  experimental  approaches  were  used.  For  example,  some  of  the  songs  and 
connecting  elements  were  imagined  as  potential  parts  of  a  combinatory  system,  driven  by 
algorithms that might shuffle sounds, images and even whole scenes. In such systems, no two 
versions  are  the  same.  Although,  in  the  end,  we  did  not  use  an  algorithmic  system,  the 
combinatory concept shaped the creative approach and logic. Second, we decided to record the 
script in advance of shooting the film. This decision enhanced a creative freedom and allowed for 
lots of play between dialog, images and sounds. The result disconnect between voice and image 
is  evocative  of  early  film  and  radio  drama,  and  the  approach  is  also  similar  to  a  workflow 
frequently used in animation. 
 
The  lyrical  elements  --  songs  and  poetically  constructed  vocal  sequences  --  provide 
psychological  and  emotional  expression.  For  example,  the  opening  tone  is  partially  created 
through  distant  marine  weather  reports  that  fade  in  and  out.  The  reports  echo  Tanek's 
psychological state of anxiety and confusion. An early report announces:  

Viking: westerly winds about 3, increasing a little, snow squalls, swell 2,5 meters 
and rising. Skagerrak: northeast to east about 5, decreasing then rising, gales then 
not. Quiet, shifting southeast to south, locally misty, sea 4 meters and sagging. 

Soon, reports announce war, environmental contamination, floods and death:  

Dover,  Wight,  Portland,  Plymouth:  West.  Cyclonic  storm  force  10.  Rough, 
occasionally very rough in Portland and Plymouth. Rain, becoming wintry later. 
Bombing  predicted  400  UTC  to  800  UTC.  Severe.  Shannon,  Rockall:  West  or 
northwest  6  to  gale  8,  increasing  severe  gale  9  for  a  time  in  Rockall.  Severe 
conditions.  Implosions,  contamination.  Risk  of  death.  Malin:  Northwest  5  or  6 
backing west 6 to gale 8, perhaps severe gale 9 later. Severe conditions. No known 
survivors...  Parnu,  Gdansk:  Code  Red.  Severe  contamination.  Contact  lost.  All 
believed  dead.  Ristna,  Helsinki.  Code  Red.  Severe  Conditions.  Contact  lost. 
Skagerrak,  Narva.  Sever  Conditions.  Contact  lost....  Malin,  Gone.  Amsterdam. 
Gone. Hamburg. Gone. Gdansk. Gone.  

 
This play on technology, psychology and story unfolds more elaborately in "The Time 
Song". This music sequence focuses on the speaking clock, a 20th Century technology with which, 
once upon a time, an individual could dial a telephone number to hear a mechanical voice telling 
the current time. In this version, based on a text by Deb Olin Unferth, the speaking clock is a 
technology  gone  wrong.  In  its  terrifyingly  insistent,  forward  motion,  its  language  exposes  an 
aggression and chaos that reflect Tanek's inner anxieties. The clock implodes in its attempt to 
fulfil the structure to which it is programed. Here is a small excerpt: 

At the tone. The time will be. Now the time. Will be two. Now the time will be one. 
Now the time will be. One now. One. Now one. Now the time will be. Exactly. At 
the tone. One now. At the tone, and seconds. Now the time and. The ten will be. 
Seconds. And seconds. And five. And four. And three. Stroking two. Now four. Now 
three. Now there. The time. Will be there. And then. The time has been. And been. 
And was. And went. It went the time. And at the tone. The time. The two. The one. 
And  four.  The  second.  The  was.  The  will.  The  be.  The  time.  The  seconds.  The 

seconds. The time will. The time will. The time. The now. And now. The time will 
be. And now. The time will be. At the tone. Another. Another. Another. Exactly. 

In the spirit of silent film, the film also includes many intertitles. These are sometimes 
 
written, sometimes spoken or sometimes both written and spoken. The narrator's feminine voice 
becomes an additional character in the narrative, teasing Tanek and egging him along. Here is a 
sample in which Tanek makes his first attempt to travel through dreams: 

Narration #9, title and voice: The only way to send a message to Anna is through 

a Dream.  

Narration #10, title and voice: Send a dream to Anna to meet at the station! Wasn’t 

she meant to meet him there before - So hard to remember 

Narration #11, voice only, no title card: Remember, Tanek, remember.

shooting action sequences in the green box studio. 

 
While the sound was being recorded in Louisville by Krzysztof Wołek, in Philadelphia, 
 
Logan Gardner worked with Coover to design the virtual environments in Blender and make the 
measurements for the shoot in the green box studio. Having correct measurements was vital to 

be able to accurately mark out the spaces on the floor of the studio using green tape so actors 
would know where to move and so the cameras could be correctly placed to ensure the actions 
and designed backgrounds would line up. The designs included both simple block models for 
preparing the staging and camera angles, and, with time, more elaborate designs with texturing. 
Several settings were made with reference to specific films and works of art. For example, the 
bar  in  the  factory  space  references  Edward  Hopper's  1942  painting,  "Nighthawks".  These 
references help signal genre slippage and confusions of signification, as if, in the dreamlike world, 
the protagonist is thrown from one genre to another, causing shifts of context and interpretation.  
 
Filming in the greenbox studio 
 
For the action filming, the team designed a 3-D rig using two Sony FS7 video cameras 
joined on a metal bar. The handmade rig provided stereoscopic image that could then be layered 
upon the 360-degree image using a plane-to-sphere image conversion tool. For this to work, the 
positions of the characters had to be calculated precisely. The calculations were based on the use 
of prime lenses. Most scenes were shot using 35mm or 50mm prime lenses. During shooting we 
verified the match, such as in this scene in which the doppelgänger was going to be crouching 
near a bush. See Figure 7.  
 
The project uses a mix of images recorded in natural settings and those created using 
digital  design  tools.  The  scenes  for  human  action  that  are  created  in  Blender®  include  the 
observatory, the station, a meeting point in the tunnels, and the interior bar and tunnels of the 
old factory as well as the insides of the clocks (Figure 1) and zoetropes (Figure 3). Some other 
experiences are also created in Blender® such as watching a passing train and flying through a 
wormhole (Figure 4).  
 
Other  scenes  are  layered  upon  seemingly  natural  settings  and  natural  elements  are 
layered upon and within images. For example, Figure 5 is a frame from a scene in which Anna 
removes her glove to reveal her strange, glass arm. The background image uses VR video filmed 
near a military bunker, and the image is altered for color. The image of Anna, which was filmed 
in the greenbox, and the arm, which was rendered is Blender®, are combined and placed upon 
the background. Shadows are added to her clothes and the ground around her.

Conclusion  
The  Key  To  Time  combines  elements  created  using  multiple  technologies  and  was 
 
designed for output for differing presentation platforms. Applying questions early expressionist 
film to VR, The Key To Time explores ways that gesture and design can express emotional tensions 
between subject and object. In drawing upon early surrealist film, The Key To Time uses the VR 
experience to question how the meanings of objects and actions relate to their surroundings or 
to the surface narratives in which they are encountered. By turning attention to the apparatus of 
cinema, The Key To Time asks how cinematic, immersive technologies and their constructs of 
time may work upon the imagination.  

 
The dreamlike narrative structure was well suited to allowing for a playful exploration of 
these technologies, which propelled aesthetic shifts and both opened, and closed, differing paths 
for  the  story.  Sifting  between  technologies  and  their  platforms  both  in  production  and 
presentation enabled a play with genres and forms such as those of science fiction, surrealism, 
expressionism, opera, silent film and graphic novel. The more visually detailed, longer-length 
work, which relies on a minimum 8K 3D resolution was best suited for large-scale settings with 
live audiences and different shorter versions with some perspectival shifts and simplification of 
graphics were designed for VR HMDs. The play between VR and cinematic forms was enhanced 
by movements between platforms in preproduction, production and presentation. In doing so 
the  experience  poses  fundamental  questions  about  ways  that  differing  technologies  frame 
expressions of narrative events.
