Instagram

This paper aims to reflect on two labels that have been used to define sets of 
artifacts born out of the same context but evoking different connotations. I refer to the 
terms “post-digital” and “post-internet”. Both terms allude to a post-stage, a leap that 
announces a cultural shift, perceived by artists but difficult to pinpoint and demarcate 
with precision, a prefix that might refer to ‘after’ (chronologically) as well as ‘beyond’ 
(spatially);  often  used  to  highlight  that  what  has  been  superseded  is  the  novelty  and 
exceptionality of the internet and digital technology. Actually, these terms address the 
fact that digital media is no longer a form of mediation but it has become our ontology, 
though this new form of being is of such a diffuse, complex and assembled nature, not 
even Haraway could have anticipated it. 

Triggered  by  impulses  of  excess  and  overindulgence,  on  the  one  hand,  or 
sustainability  and  preservation,  on  the  other,  post-internet  and  post-digital  art  emerge 
from a networking and tech-savvy sensibility that has altered the relation between artist, 
audience, and art object. 

In particular, I am going to focus on the work of artists that use Instagram as an 
art  gallery  for  exhibiting  their  work  (Almudena  Lobera,  Andrés  Reisinger,  Lucy 
Hardcastle) or to sabotage the platform from the inside (Amalia Ulman, Cory Arcangel). 
Bearing  a  family  resemblance  to  electronic  literature,  these  works  also  explore  the 
narrative process in the construction of an artist’s identity, the changing  territories of 
human-machine/artist-spectator  interactions  and  digital-analogue  materializations.  The 
art objects they produce can be classified as “phygital”, physical/digital constructs that 
inhabit, in a myriad of different possibilities of mediation and convergence, the physical 
and the digital spaces of mixed reality. 

As artists explore the platform’s potential as exhibition space, advertising site, 
and conversation aisle, their phygital objects reflect the tensions between a nostalgia for 
an  analogue  craftsmanship  which  rebels  against  machinic  perfection  and  an 

interrogation of human creativity that propels us into the future through an ever more 
profound symbiosis with our technological habitus. 
 
Part I: Defining post-digital and post-internet aesthetics 
 

Let us start by attempting to define what is the meaning attributed to the label 
“post-digital”, which is the main concept I would like to address. When do we start to 
hear this term?  

It has been around since the year 2000, when electronic music composer Kim 
Casone, inspired by Negroponte’s sentence “The digital revolution is over,” decided to 
refer  to  a  type  of  musical  experimentation,  emerging  from  non-academic,  self-taught 
composers, as “postdigital” in his artice “The Aesthetics of Failure.” “The post-digital 
aesthetics,” according to Casone, “was developed in part as a result of the immersive 
experience of working in environments suffused with digital technology" (12), but more 
specifically from the attention paid to the failure of these technologies: system crashes, 
bugs, glitches, distortion, noise floor…signals that these technologies were as imperfect 
as  the  humans  who  made  them,  and  which  were  incorporated  in  the  musical 
compositions. 

From  that  moment,  the  post-digital  has  been  associated  with  a  process  of 
“amateurization”  in  art:  everybody  can  become  an  artist  using  DIY  techniques,  low 
tech, recycled materials and software, found objects and tools lying "around the house." 
Moreover, the post-digital condition requires that the artist, nearly everyone, becomes 
his or her own agent, using platforms such as Instagram as exhibition venues to attract 
audiences  and  make  their  art  viral.  Within  this  framework,  we  assist  to  the  growing 
importance of user-generated content in a transmedia ecology, which has contributed to 
exacerbate  the  overabundance  of  data,  images,  videos,  and  to  instil  the  logic  of 
extruding data, both as creative practice and as a method to attribute cultural value. 

As it happens with other words, such as “postmodernism” or “post-pop”, “post-
digital” implies, more than anything, a change in attitude. Emerging from a framework 
in which technology is naturalized, a post-digital aesthetics would be one in which the 
artist,  through  his  or  her  creations,  provokes  a  tension  that  makes  visible  the 
interpenetration  of  digital  technology  in  every  layer  of  our  lives.  We  could  say  it 
coexists  with  the  digital  and  even  the  pre-digital,  but  it  involves  a  critical  attitude 
regarding the notion of digital progress, questioning the positivist ideology that assumes 

technological  development  as  a  linear  progress:  inevitable,  neutral  and,  ultimately, 
beneficial.  

The post-digital attitude has also been associated with a nostalgic retromaniac 
turn (Cramer), but from the vantage position of one who already dominates the present 
technology. Or we should rather say that a post-digital aesthetics makes the distinction 
between  old  and  new  media  obsolete  by  eclectically  appropriating  techniques  and 
materials from an array of digital and analogical practices to create something new, at 
once  strangely  familiar  and  awry.  It  also  supposes  a  turn-of-the-screw  regarding 
previous strategies: moving from technology appropriation, from a Marxist perspective 
‒harnessing  the  power  technology  can  grant  us‒,  to  reappropriation,  as  in  Tactical 
Media  ‒repurposing  existing  technology  so  at  to  undo  Lorde’s  statement  that  the 
master’s  tools  will  never  dismantle  the  master’s  house‒;  from  the  promise  of  fluid 
identity  of 
the  body  exposition  and  postproduction  (or 
postdigitalization) of identity in the social networks of the post-digital age.  

the  digital  age 

to 

Concurrently,  at  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century,  a  series  of  artists  began  to 
reflect on the impact of the use of the Internet and its technologies in our life, but using 
creative venues outside the Internet, returning to the plasticity of objects in the physical 
space of the gallery. Artist Cory Arcangel explicitly addressed this decision: “It is not 
until digital technology manifests itself physically that we can easily grasp its effects on 
our society and the environment” (Greene Naftali np). This type of art that thematises 
the effects of extensive Internet use in disconnected creative practices was called post-
internet  art.  Marisa  Olson,  one  of  its  early  proponents,  describes  it  as  the  process  of 
creating art following time spent utilizing and exploring the World Wide Web. What is 
made after is the product of this excessive computer use or indulgence of the internet. 
The internet has shifted from being an escapist pastime from the world, to become the 
world one seeks to escape from. She quotes Artie Vierkant’s ‘The Image Object Post-
Internet,’ whose own definition of the term describes it ‘a result of the contemporary 
moment: inherently informed by ubiquitous authorship, the development of attention as 
currency,  the  collapse  of  physical  space  in  networked  culture,  and  the  infinite 
reproducibility and mutability of digital materials’ (Olson, 61). Brian Droitcour, in his 
demolishing post “Why I hate post-internet art,” adds: “post-internet art does to art what 
porn does to sex”, implying that post-internet artists care more about the idea of success 
in  the  art  world  than  anything  else,  no  matter  how  lacking  they  may  be  in  the 
craftsmanship abilities one associates with artistic production. According to him, they 

have mimicked in their pieces the visual vocabulary of product advertising and brand 
communication strategies that proliferate in the networks. As a result, “It’s boring to be 
around [post-internet art]. It’s not really sculpture. It doesn’t activate space. It’s frontal, 
designed to preen for the camera’s lens.  It’s an  assemblage of some sort, and there’s 
little excitement in the way objects are placed together, and nothing is well made except 
for the mass-market products in it.”  

Of  course,  though  Droitcour’s  criticism  of  post-internet  art  might  be  acutely 
insightful with regards some of its products, one needs to delve deeply into the matter to 
understand what is valuable in each contribution. But we should also ask: are the post-
digital  and  post-internet  aesthetics  one  and  the  same,  or  can  we  already  perceive  a 
division between the good and the bad art along the lines: it is boring and commercial 
and thus we are going to call it post-internet art, or, it is cool and inspiring, we are going 
to call it “post-digital”? 

In  some  of  the  works  of  the  artists  we  are  going  to  discuss  later,  these 
accusations  appear  as  unfair,  since  they  certainly  show  their  virtuosity,  both  in  the 
traditional arts ‒as in the sculptural works of Almudena Lobera‒ and in their knowledge 
of code ‒as in the works of Cory Arcangel‒, but what  I am particularly interested in 
analysing is their activation of space. By introducing in the physical space of the gallery 
the  communication  habits  of  the  internet  networks  and  platforms,  they  challenge  our 
perception  of  the  “medium”,  both  physical  and  virtual,  and  highlight  its  collapse, 
convergence, and multi-faceted condition.  

The  post-digital  aesthetics  pierces  the  dichotomy  between  the  virtual  and  the 
physical space, producing artifacts that can no longer be read or enjoyed fully in one or 
the  other  space,  but  exist  somewhere  in  the  middle.  In  fact,  the  “phygical”  artifacts 
inhabit  the  realms  of  what  is  being  called  Mixed  Reality,  which  expands  along  the 
reality-virtuality  continuum  (Milgram).  As  Schnabel  proposes,  these  realms  include: 
Real Reality, Mixed Reality with Amplified Reality1, Augmented Reality, Mediated and 
Diminished Reality2, Augmented Virtuality3, Virtualised Reality4, and Virtual Reality 
(4). 

                                                           
1  Amplified  Reality  (AR)  shifts  the  perspective  from  the  viewer  (as  in  augmented  reality’s  hardware, 
which  projects  images  onto  the  object  that  only  the  viewer  with  an  electronic  device  can  see)  to  the 
objects, by providing the objects with additional layers of data. 
2 Diminished Reality (DR) refers to techniques for visually concealing, eliminating, and seeing through 
real objects. 
3 Augmented virtuality (AV) refers to the merging of real-world objects into virtual worlds. 

 

 
 
Other  writers,  however,  refer  to  the  term  “extended  reality”  (XR)  as  the 
encompassing  term  and  mixed  reality  as  its  central  area.  In  any  case,  the  essential 
quality  of  mixed  reality  is  that  the  digital  and  the  physical  planes  coexist  and  are 
integrated, either by introducing the digital object in the space around us or the physical 
objects in the virtual plane.   

Thus  the  “phygital”  ontology  of  postdigital  art  is  not  of  a  single  quality,  but 
rather  it  stretches  along  a  spectrum  of  possibilities  and  positions  itself  along  the 
multiplicity  of  layers  that  form  this  hybrid,  mixed,  reality:  physical  objects  in  digital 
environments,  digital  objects  in  physical  environments,  “phygital  objects”  existing  at 
the  same  time  in  both,  physical  and  digital  spaces,  AR  artifacts  complementing  the 
incomplete physical object or plane of existence, digital objects that have cannibalized 
an analogical technique or that propose a reencounter with the physical plane in trompe 
l’oeil  materializations,  etc.  The  range  of  possibilities  seems  to  be  as  wide  as  the 
imagination  of  the  artist,  but  each  combination  is  indirectly  posing  questions  and 
positioning itself regarding our  conception of reality and the correct balance between 
ourselves and our technological prostheses.  

Moreover,  in  order  to  be  really  post-digital,  these  artifacts  also  have  to  be 
submitted to post-digital processes, operations that imbue them with an extra layer of 
surreality and imagination. Through our study of a few post-digital artists we are going 
to attempt to pinpoint some of these processes. 

 

                                                                                                                                                                          
4 Virtualized reality (VR) immerses viewers in a virtual reconstruction of real-world spaces and events, 
incorporating real images and depth information computed from these images, and allowing the viewers 
to select their perspective. 

Part II: Post-digital processes and Instagram 
 

1.  Recycling technological detritus: 

 
By  nostalgically  recycling  and  repurposing  old  media  and  technology,  post-
digital artists highlight the speed with which the capitalist economy makes everything 
obsolete. Artist Cory Arcangel, for example, seems to have found the proper amount of 
time one needs to go back to make the retro use of old programs and technology “cool” 
again,  and  that  is  five  or  six  years.  In  one  of  his  most  famous  works,  “Super  Mario 
Clouds”, he alters the graphic card of the game so that all the graphics are eliminated 
except the background, a blue sky with moving clouds (Fig. 1).  
 
 

Fig. 1.   “Super Mario Clouds” (2002). 

 

 

 
This interesting move of isolating the background is also shared with Casone’s 
post-digital  electronic  music  composers,  for  whom  concepts  such  as  “detritus,”  “by-
product,”  and  “background”  or  (“horizon”)  are  the  new  focus  of  their  attention.  As 
Casone writes: “the basic composition of “background” is comprised of data we filter 
out to focus on our immediate surroundings. The data hidden in our perceptual “blind 
spot” contains worlds waiting to be explored” (13-14). Choosing to shift our focus there 
will involve exploring the boundary of “normal” functions and uses of software. It will 
also  allow  us  to  pay  more  attention  to  that  which  we  discard:  the  “detritus”  of 
contemporary society may have more to say about us than the perfected piece of art. 

2.  Post-digital  ekphrasis5:  Recontextualizing 

the  platform’s  communicative 

strategies. 
 
Spanish  artist  Almudena  Lobera  (1984-)  puts  a  frame  to  the  background,  the 
landscape, so that we can become aware of the prominence it has achieved. However 
the viewer is not there, it is only seeing the picture, which has been emptied of human 
figures, helping us reflect on the simulacra, or the second-hand nature, of our quotidian 
experiences.  This  image  also  represents  the  transfer  of  receptive  modes  across  media 
and the impossibility of an unmediated glance.

Lobera,  a  plastic  artist  that  connects  classical  sculpture  and  still-life  painting 
with computer programs, has become relevant to Spanish audiences thanks to her active 
role in Instagram, where she communicates frequently with her audience, and, following 

                                                           
5 Ekphrasis is the verbal representation of a visual representation. It is a type of intermediality in which 
the creator chooses a different  medium than expected (in traditional ekphrasis, the  written  medium) to 
describe an image or visual representation. We can refer to a type of ekphrasis characteristic of the post-
digital era when a publication medium, platform or format is selected for a purpose for which it was not 
originally designed. For example, the use of Instagram and scrolling to animate a series of images, such 
as the one made by the Red Lion advertising agency in Toronto (Canada) to promote the Toronto Silent 
Film Festival in its 2013 edition (See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVytk4p4If8).

Commissions Miami Beach (Dec 01-06, 2015). 

Arcangel  postdigital  tendencies,  she  also  feels  compelled  to  bring  these  digital 
consumption and communication modes to the physical gallery. In her work "Stories" 
(2018)7, she proposes another way of visiting an art exhibition, modifying the logic of 
the location of the work, the space and the viewer. In this case, her work will be the one 
that  moves  by  means  of  a  conveyor  belt  parallel  to  the  perimeter  of  the  room  floor, 
moving continuously with a sample of pieces located in it. These pieces, selected and 
organized  so  that  the  spectator  can  construct  his  or  her  own  particular  narrative, 
compose  a  unitary  exhibition  inside  another.  The  overarching  one  mimics  the 
exploration of art pieces in Instagram ‒moving from one piece to another with a finger‒, 
and  reminds  the  viewer  that  the  exhibition  continues  living  in  other  spaces.  As 
spectator, you are propelled to take an active role as you let the exhibition pass in front 
of you and are invited to record it with your smartphone, uploading the video to your 
own “stories” in Instagram (Fig. 3).

With  this  project,  Almudena  Lobera  wants  to  transmit  “a  critical  and  ironic 
staging of the prevailing consumer and communication mechanisms in our days”. In this 
case, the virtual spaces of the internet and the physical space of the gallery are clearly 
demarcated,  though  the  modes  of  communication  and  image  consumption  of  both 
spaces  contaminate  one  another  in  an  endless  cycle  of  conspicuous  consumption  and 
production. 

Cory  Arcangel,  −whose  main  approach  is  to  intervene  and  appropriate 
technological gadgets, introducing a change, sometimes a glitch, to make the familiar 
turn  uncanny−,  has  also  a  series  of  pieces  in  which  he  externalizes  and  intervenes 
Instagram’s communication practices through the use of bots. As in we deliver / the king 
checked  by  the  queen  or  in  the  work  of  unpronounceable  name  in  fig.  4,  Arcangel 
presents  video  recordings  of  automated  performances  in  Instagram,  producing 
nonsensical and disturbing pieces that completely obliterate aesthetic contemplation.

Curiously enough, Marisa Olson describes post-internet art as coming from “a 
post-ekphrastic  image  philosophy”,  a  moment  of  discernment  that  the  image  could 
speak  for  itself  metareflexively,  without  the  need  for  words,  and  thus  turning  the 
rhetorical  exercise  of  “ekphrasis”  obsolete.  However,  this  intermedial  practice,  as  we 
have seen, is metamorphosed into a particular kind of post-digital ekphrasis when, for 
example, the artist uses another medium (the art exhibit) to describe Instagram’s image 
consumption  habits  or  uses  Instagram  for  a  purpose  for  which  it  was  not  originally 
designed (a bot performance), and, in this way, exposes the perversion of the platform’s 
communicative strategies. 
 

3.  Augmented  virtuality  or  how  to  regain  the  artistic(-commercial)  aura  in 

Instagram. 
 

Andrés  Reisinger,  a  Barcelona-based  3D  designer  has  also  become  a  referent  in 
post-digital artifacts, using  Instagram as communication venue and virtual gallery, he 
introduces physical objects in 3D virtual spaces of a surreal quality to recreate a poetic 
background  in  which  these  objects  obtain  their  sense  of  belonging.  In  this  case,  the 
physical object, a “sculptural” armchair (Fig. 5) for example, is inscribed in the virtual 
plane to the point that it loses its connection with the real, material world, and acquires 
an ethereal aura. The aura of the art object is regained through its virtualization. Instead 
of  appealing  to  a  unique  existence  in  the  physical  space  and  time,  the  digital  space 
provides for a new sensory experience of distance between the viewer and the object.

Fig. 6. Lucy Hardcastle Studio in Instagram. 
 
 

 

Lucy  Hardcastle  Studio,  based  in  London  and  with  nearly  8000  followers  in 
Instagram, investigates the tensions between technology and traditional craft. As they 
observe in the description of one of their projects9, their inspiration is drawn from the 
post-internet  ethos  “of  being  constantly  connected  and  constantly  seeking  visual 
gratification”. In this case, Hardcastle, like Reisinger, is inspired by online digital art to 
create physical objects, in this case printed fabrics, but her intention is to confront, play 
a mirror game between the physical and the digital plane, challenging in the process the 
perfectionism in both the fashion and digital design worlds. The journey moves from 
the  qualities  of  physical  objects  ‒like  liquids,  ice,  soft  materials‒  and  their  textures, 
which  are  then  conveyed  to  the  digital  objects,  such  as  images  and  3D  sculptures, 
through  rendering  software,  and  then  suffused  back  in  physical  materials,  the  printed 
fabrics  that  are  used  to  create  wallpapers,  rugs,  curtains,  etc.  The  online  object  is 
recreated physically, confronting the differences in materiality between the two planes, 
the digital and the physical, one the clone of the other and back again. The result is a 
series of printed fabrics with illusionary textures and digital tromp l’oeil effects, since

physical and digital objects (lucyhardcastle.com/glow). 

the end products lack those qualities that have been recreated in 2D, such as ripples, 
roughness, contours, and even temperatures. The end result establishes also a game with 
the  spectator  that  consumes  these  images  through  Instagram,  since  it  becomes  a 
challenge to decipher which is the digital object and which is a photograph of a physical 
one, reproducing the digital characteristics. 

As  we  have  seen,  Lobera  places  the  digital  consumption  and  communication 
habits in the physical space of the gallery, while Reisinger inserts the physical object in 
a digital landscape and Hardcastle moves back and forth between the two planes, as an 
exploration of their mutual influences  and tensions.  In  all three  cases, a return to the 
physical object and to craftsmanship is important. Instagram is a channel to exhibit their 
exploration along the reality-virtuality continuum and showcase their creations. There 
are other artists, however, whose intention is to address more directly the role of the 
platform in the configuration of our consumer habits, and thus they end up sabotaging 
the platforms from the inside.  
 

4.  Flouting the platform’s veracity principle: 

 
One  technique  to  do  so  is  to  ironically  reproduce  the  platforms’  aestheticized 

content. As Boris Groys has observed:  

Today,  everyone  is  subjected  to  an  aesthetic  evaluation—everyone  is 
required to take aesthetic responsibility for his or her appearance in the 
world,  for  his  or  her  self-design.  Where  it  was  once  a  privilege  and  a 
burden  for  the  chosen  few,  in  our  time  self-design  has  come  to  be  the 
mass cultural practice par excellence. 

Amalia Ulman (Argentina, 1989) has used Instagram to both construct her work 
and expose the toxic nature of its own framework. The general theme of her net art is 
the way in which relationships are built from appearances, which she has exploited by 
creating  her  own  fictional  narratives  around  identity  construction  in  Instagram.  Her 
most celebrated project to date is Excellences and Perfections10, which flouts flagrantly 
the already weakened veracity principle attributed to online profiles (Fig.5-7). During 
six months of 2014, Ulman built a story of an extreme make-over through  Instagram 
posts that were not her  own, even though she signed them with her name (confusing

friends and acquaintances alike). It recounted the experiences of a girl in her twenties 
looking  for  success  in  the  city  of  Los  Angeles.  From  the  apparently  idyllic  life  of  a 
naïve  girl  to  the  struggles  of  the  sexy  vamp,  she  goes  through  break-up  with  her 
boyfriend,  injects  Botox,  falls  into  drugs,  undergoes  cosmetic  surgery  for  breast 
augmentation, suffers a nervous breakdown and, after hitting rock bottom, resurfaces. 
She  built  a  complete  story  made  with  hashtags  and  in  the  image  and  likeness  of  the 
profiles of many girls her age that she found on the social network.

Fig. 8. Image of Intimidad Romero’s Facebook project. 
 

Amalia Ulman, like Intimidad Romero, plays with identity construction in social 
networks, blurring the boundaries between lived reality, masquerade and pastiche. Their 
work  is  prototypically  a  post-internet  product  born  out  of  excessive  exposition  to 
internet images. They denounce how the networks have enslaved us into living for them 
exposing  more  and  more  of  our  post-produced  “real”  life,  instead  of  facilitating  the 
promised  liquid  identity  that  would  allow  you  to  be  whoever  you  desired,  at  least 
online.  In  the  case  of  Intimidad  Romero  (her  artistic  name  and  that  of  her  Facebook 

project11), the pixilation and thus self-censure to which she subjected her own images 
(Fig. 8), provoked Facebook to close her account.  

In  both  cases,  what  is  subversive  is  that  the  real  identity  of  the  artist  remains 
elusive,  either  by  faking  a  banal  yet  popular  ego  or  by  self-censuring  it  before  the 
platform has a chance to do it, thus the artist invents new norms for the algorithm to 
deal with. 
 

5.  Implausible exhibits and data collection 

 
Joshua  Citarella’s  work,  Compression  Artifacts  (2013)12,  also  belongs  to  this 
second stage in the relationship between art and the digital sphere initiated by the web 
2.0 and its new forms of participation. In this case, Citarella addresses the dominance of 
the  digital  networks  as  new  exhibition  spaces  (even  before  the  Covid  pandemic)  and 
plays  with 
the  array  of  possible  mediations  between  physical  and  virtual 
representations.  

For this piece, Citarella has constructed in a secret location what appears to be 
an exhibition space. There is no way any spectator can reach it physically since we have 
not  been  informed  of  its  existence  prior  to  its  deconstruction.  The  construction  was 
performed in front of a live feed, broadcast during daylight hours. The process was thus 
recorded, and then postproduced to augment its size or to decrease it at will, its objects 
also dematerialized by fire. Eventually everything is brought to its ashes. What remains 
is the process as recorded in videos and photographs disseminated in the networks. 

As in Almudena Lobera’s “Stories”, in this piece we find an exhibition inside 
another, but what is at stake really in this performatic, procedural work, is its implicit 
commentary  on  the  importance  granted  to  the  exhibition  space,  the  container,  and 
conversely the art objects that comprise the installation become banal. Again, it is the 
context, the background, which is laid bare and questioned.

Conclusion: 
 

Artists’ use of Instagram and other platforms is twofold: at once it benefits from 
their dissemination potential, as it also poses a critical stance regarding their algorithms’ 
logic. They are aware of the commercial objectives of the platforms and try to skew or 
appropriate them, depending on their own intentions. As Kenneth Goldsmith has also 
observed: “While we play the Instagram game by liking and reposting photos, the apparatus 
knows  otherwise:  a  like  is  a  way  for  the  shareholder  to  verify  that  there  are  consumers 
populating the program” (144). 

For Spanish critic Juan Martín Prada, the immateriality of the net art work was a 
problem for its commercialization and post-internet art implies a return to the object, 
(not only to make a clearest statement, as Arcangel defends) but to be able to sell it. 
Nowadays,  we  could  say,  following  Latour,  that  we  were  never  modern,  not  even 
postmodern, since we have managed to commercialize virtual objects by making them 
scarce,  unique,  once  again.  Through  blockchain  technology,  the  non-fungible  tokens 
(NFT) have returned if not the aura to the work of art, at least its monetary value. 

In  the  same  way  that  Marisa  Olson  identified  post-internet  art  as  a  type  of 
production  that  was  not  strictly  computer/internet  based,  but  rather  that  it  could  be 
identified as any type of art that is in some way influenced by the internet and digital 
media, post-digital electronic literature is also experiencing this overture towards other 

works  that  might  not  be  strictly  classified  as  electronic  literature  but  spring  from  a 
similar  experimentation  with  platforms  and  artistic  creation,  traversed  by  or  going 
through  computer  programs  and  machinic  spaces,  and  reaching  out  to  find  new 
audiences. As close relatives in the artistic field, we have identified the same impulses 
in  post-digital  electronic  literature  as  we  have  perceived  in  these  artists:  a  nostalgic 
mixture  of  analogic  and  digital  techniques,  a  renewed  interest  in  technological 
obsolescence  and  sustainability,  and  an  inquiring  attitude  towards  an  ever-expanding 
technological mediation. 

Though  it  is  difficult  to  demarcate  these  categories,  we  observe  that  we  can 
identify two trends along the commercial or critical positioning of the authors, though 
many will mix these trends in their works. If post-internet art is an art of conspicuous 
consumption in which the self-aware internet user makes post-internet art as a prosumer 
every  time  he/she  visits  these  installations  and  participates  in  the  performance,  post-
digital  art  focuses  on  the  transcendence  of  the  medium  by  recontextualizing, 
recuperating, reusing ad infinitum, fragments of old and new media, calling for the need 
to  find  an  equilibrium  between  the  different  spaces  we  inhabit,  virtual  and  real, 
identifying the particular qualities, textures, structures, in each of the manifold layers of 
reality we move about. 

But  what  happens  when  digital  technology  is  capable  of  reproducing  to 
perfection  the  qualities  of  the  physical  medium,  does  the  traditional  association  and 
classification  of  art  objects  with  their  medium  disappear?  In  never-ending  cycles  of 
appropriation and  re-appropriation, production and digital post-production, inscription 
and 
recontextualization,  mediation  and 
remediation,  where  does  one  locate  the  importance  of  the  medium?  Or,  should  we 
conclude, as Spanish critic Germán Sierra believes, that in post-digital art the medium is 
destroyed with the message?  

re-inscription,  contextualization  and 

Maybe “destroyed” is excessive, but certainly in post-digital art the medium is 
problematized, strained, its limits exposed. However, we do not seem to have moved 
beyond the need of self-referencing the medium constantly, as all nascent media do ‒
and as we know electronic literature has done for a long time‒, since new combinations 
of  mixed  reality  become  possible  every  day,  continuously  expanding  our  horizon  of 
expectations. What is certain is that the aesthetical experience has been forever altered 
by  the  platforms’  modes  of  consumption  and  production,  veering  audiences  to  a 
perpetual state of distraction rather than contemplation.
