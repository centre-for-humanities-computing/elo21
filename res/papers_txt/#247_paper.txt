 

ONEIROGRAFIA - THE WRITING OF DREAMS 

 

Author: Andréa Catrópa 
 
Abstract: Oneirografia is an interactive digital work that proposes a reflection on the role 
of  dreams  in  our  lives.  Created  from  research  initiated  in  2020,  during  the  Covid-19 
pandemic, the work began with internet searchers on a particular dream. Subsequently, 
this  creative  process  became  an  investigation  into  the  atavistic  relationships  that  the 
human species maintains with dreams and observed the different meanings that this state 
of mind has acquired throughout our history.  

Oneirografia is inspired by dream experiences and allows the  user to navigate in a 3D 
environment.  Into  this  environment,  is  possible  to  receive  the  message  of  the  oracle, 
which is a combinatorial poem. In addition, the user can make up his e-dreams. Composed 
of  the  choices  made  during  navigation,  e-dreams  mix  images,  filters,  and  text.  It  is 
possible, from there, to save the formed images or share them.

Oneirografia  is  a  work  of  digital  literature  whose  creation  process  began  almost 
simultaneously with the arrival of restrictive measures to circulation and socialization due 
to the pandemic of Covid-19 in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The work was motivated by 
a  dream,  and  this  process  started  in  March  2020,  unfolded  in  bibliographic  and 
iconography research. That same year, the partial results of this research were presented 
at some national and international academic congresses and I´ve published an article on 
this subject [1]. 

In  the  first  phase  of  the  project,  the  research  focused  on  a  search  for  correspondence 
between  the  dream  that  motivated  them  and  their  possible  connections  to  the  waking 
world. Since the night experience had as a scenario a certain geographical locality, the 
city  of  Prague,  and  this  was  unknown  to  the  dreamer,  the  first  resource  used  for  this 
verification was the internet search algorithms. Thus, correlates were sought between the 
dreamed city and its physical configuration. Due to the impossibility of traveling to do 
on-the-spot research, either by restrictions caused by the spread of coronavirus, or by high 
costs and travel distance between South and Central Europe, the Internet has proved to be 
a viable resource for research. 

The initial verification was based on a translation of the dreamlike images into the natural 
language which, in turn, was used to trigger the search mechanisms. These mechanisms 
translate into code the typed letters, submitting to the performance optimization processes 
of the search algorithms the semantic structures filtered from the dream by consciousness, 
which attempts to organize rationally the dreamlike deviations that flee from the logic of 
the facts observed in daylight. 

The path described was followed by the creation of a dream map, which was not intended 
for  aesthetic  fruition,  but  only  for  the  dream  record  for  future  reflections  and 
consultations, as its details were erased from memory over time. In some ways, too, the 
map intertwines an imponderable and intimate experience to how seekers define the city 
of Prague through its monuments, its buildings, and its historical characters for the virtual 
tourist. 

 

The dream images were thus transformed into a verbal simplification, used as an input to 
generate  outputs  such  as  museum  sites,  Wikipedia  entries,  official  and  amateur 
photographs  of  monuments  and  the  most  visited  places  in  Prague,  pages  with  tourist 
information,  recommendations of bars, shops,  markets,  cafes,  restaurants and hotels in 
the  city  (with  their  respective  user  reviews),  maps  and  virtual  representations  of  the 
environments via Google Street View. 

These data gathered both the contributions of residents, as well as information shared by 
visitors, all filtered by the algorithms and customized according to the researcher's profile 
information  since  this  calibration  by  user  profile  is  a  common  practice  of  internet 
searchers.  In  this  way,  it  can  be  said  that  the  dream  map  points  to  an  imaginary  city, 
created  by  the  conjunction  of  collective  inputs,  algorithmic  tracking,  and  the  personal 
element of reworking the dream experience. 

The elaboration of the dream map allowed the research, from then on, to revolve around 
the  terms  that  signaled  a  consensus  on  the  world  of  dreams  and  the  verification,  by 
algorithmic mediation, of facts and particularities virtually accessible concerning the city 
of Prague. However, even though the result of this research method has been fruitful and 
has raised material for theoretical reflection and artistic creation, since the beginning of 
2021, we have opted for a path different from what has been followed so far. 

The perception that the pandemic did not cool down and kept a large part of the world 
population  in  a  state  of  exception  due  to  the  growing  health,  economic  and  social 
problems  contributed  to  the  questioning  of  the  validity  of  creating  a  work  aimed  at  a 
particular experience. Somehow, the coronavirus, its transmissibility, and its lethality put 
into question some values that define the daily lives of most citizens living in western 
metropolises, such as narcissism and exacerbated individualism. The possibility of falling 
ill, of losing one's own life or loved ones due to a virus that travels through the air, from 
one  body  to  another,  emphasizes  human  vulnerability,  reminding  us  of  the  animal 
contingency of depending on a body whose functioning lasts for a finite time. 

We are virtual beings, if we wish, only to the extent that our bodies live. But before that, 
we are mortal and this fact cannot be controlled only with willpower, regular exercise, 
and  healthy  eating.  We  are  aware  of  social  inequalities  and  their  effects  even  more 
perverse in this pandemic. Even so, even though they are less susceptible to complications 
when they become infected, there are also young people, there are athletes, there are rich 
people  who  succumb  to  the  coronavirus.  If,  when  programming  smart  computers,  we 
dreamed of living in a world purified of human imperfection, we now see, most sadly and 
harshly, how different we are from machines. This emphasizes our links as a species and 
made the creative process based on a particular experience less significant than working 
with the atavistic relationships that we maintain with dreaming. 

Scientific studies and different  reports, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, 
have been focusing on a very noticed phenomenon: the increase in the report of “abnormal 
dreams” in this long period in which a large part of the world population has experienced 
unprecedented  conditions  in  their  lives.  Students  from  the  University  of  Toronto,  for 
example,  developed  research  in  which  the  result  was  the  report  of  more  vivid  dreams 
between its participants. They´ve also related an increase in the occurrence of nightmares 
and night episodes that involved amplification of anxiety and, also, a portion of dream 
narratives that contained references to the particularities experienced by many of us in a 
pandemic daily life [2]. 

The  dream,  which  was  valued  by  Western  peoples  in  Antiquity  as  a  way  of  knowing 
future events [3], has now come to be understood, increasingly, as the result of individual 
perceptions  and  concerns.  Freud's  psychoanalytic  theory  of  dreaming  states  that  the 
censorship  of  the  conscious  operates  even  when  we´re  asleep,  and  the  unusual  dream 
language  aims  to  protect  us  from  direct  contact  with  information  that,  transmitted 
objectively, we might not be able to bear [4]. 

Ribeiro [5] proposes a link between the psychoanalytic bias and the scientific approach 
to dream mechanisms, seeking to establish their atavistic links with the human species. 
In his book, Ribeiro defines the dream as a probabilistic oracle, in which simulations of 
past events combine with future expectations in associative narratives, which allow the 
dreamer to carry out simulations that, in some way, prepare him for life. 

If we take into consideration the summary made above about some perceptions about the 
dream and the growing attention that this everyday phenomenon received from academic 
researchers during the Covid-19 pandemic, we can ask ourselves about the importance of 
this activity in our life in the past few months. And how cities and their frenetic pace have 
influenced our ability to use this ancient tool for our self-knowledge and to reflect on our 
actions in the world. 

The imaginative capability of the dreaming sleeper underwent 
a relentless erosion, and the vitiated identity of a visionary was 
left over for a tolerated minority of poets, artists, and mad 
people. Modernization could not proceed in a world populated 
with large numbers of individuals who believed in the 
value or potency of their own internal visions or voices [6]. 

Some difficulties to  resonate with  our experiences during sleep come from  the lack of 
habit of saving time, when we wake up, to remember our dreams and share them with 

other  people.  Such  difficulty  also  points  to  our  individualism  and  the  pursuit  of 
productivity  and  rationality,  which  distances  us  from  this  activity  whose  ancestral 
importance has left several marks in human culture. 

These reflections determined the new paths of our artistic creation process that resulted 
in Oneirografia. This work aims to remember and share dreams in a digital environment. 
For  this,  it  is  structured  as  follows:  after  choosing  one  of  the  languages  in  which  the 
project  is  available  (Portuguese,  Spanish,  and  English),  the  user  receives  a  welcome 
message in the chosen language. 

 

A form automatically appears on the screen in which the user will write something about 
the dream they want to remember (or create), using any language they prefer, as the three 
options listed above restrict only the languages in which the navigation instructions are 
exposed. At this stage, the work is expected to function as a kind of dream diary, in which 
the  user  can  record  his  words  in  up  to  300  characters,  divided  into  three  fields  of  100 
characters each. To proceed to the next step, you need to write something, at least one 
letter, in all fields. The idea is to encourage the user to spend time reflecting and seeking 
to recover their dream experiences, so it is not possible to advance in the work without 
completing this step. 

Then, it is possible to choose between the dream or the nightmare door. This action will 
bring  different  sound  and  chromatic  environments  for  the  crossing  of  a  corridor  that 
represents  the  separation  between  the  waking  life  for  the  dream  universe,  where  the 
actions will be more sensory and intuitive. This universe is constituted by an immersive 
3D environment, where navigation follows the structure of the games. However, the first-

 

person character does not follow rules to achieve explicit goals. The intention is that the 
exploration of this field occurs in a contemplative way, even though it allows access to 
two key elements of the work: 1) the message of the oracle; and 2) the word search, which 
finally leads the user to access his e-dream. 

The oracle's message is  a combinatory poem  composed of six variables, each with ten 
different options, which makes repetition of a composition unlikely to happen since the 
chance  of  recurrence  is  very  reduced.  In  addition,  in  the  code,  there  is  a  ban  on  the 
repetition of a poem exactly as it was conveyed in its last configuration, which further 
reduces the likelihood of a user reading the same poem. 

 

The title of the composition always repeats the structure “(variable) sends a message”, 
and, in the place of this first variable, we have ten options: Oracle, Artemidorus, Freud, 
Maya, Xoaltentli, Hypnos, Nyx, Morpheus, Icelos, Phantasos, Jurupari and Kerepiyua. 
These words represent  characters or deities related to  the world of dreams  in  different 
cultures.  The  same  permutational  logic  remains  in  the  rest  of  the  poem's  formulation, 
which in addition to the title, is composed of another three lines and five more variables. 

Versions of the poem, in one of the three languages chosen for navigation, can appear on 
the screen of a TV that is in the 3D environment if the user clicks the call button. In this 
case, a TTS (text-to-speech) mechanism is activated, and the poem also receives an audio 
version, with  the  synthetic voice  calibrated so that  it does not  have  a  regular humanly 
sound but is affected by the dreamlike atmosphere of the surroundings. 

 

To leave the environment, it is necessary to follow the trail of the bright spheres that are 
heading to a certain point: the Big Eye, which moves to always observe the movements 
of the user. By clicking on this image, the user is transported to a 3D sphere, on which is 
the word search. 

 

In the transition between the environments, the instructions appear: “capture three words 
that relate to your dream or nightmare”. In this stage, there is a determined quantity of 
concrete and abstract nouns that must be chosen due to their close relationship with the 
e-dream that the user wants to represent or create. The arrangement of terms is rearranged 
randomly each time there is an entry into the sphere. This instability in the positioning of 
words and their limited quantity, given the infinite possibilities of the dream, takes the 
user  to  a  new  contemplative  moment.  In  the  construction  of  the  dream  language, 
condensation and displacement mechanisms operate [7], which distort the messages of 
the  unconscious  so  that  they  become  bearable  for  the  dreamer.  In  word  searches,  it  is 
necessary to choose between just a few terms, perhaps not matching entirely the dream 
narrative, to  give visible shape to  a new universe, and make it an e-dream  that can be 
saved or shared. 

After selecting three words, the “create” button appears for the user. From there, he just 
needs to wait for the next screen to load to receive the result of his plunge into the world 
of dreams. 

The figure that appears to the user is formed by an image bank in which the words chosen 
in the previous step, and calibrated to represent dreams or nightmares, are combined in 
layers. In addition, one of the three fields filled in the initial form appears on the image 
composition. Some filters and distortions are used randomly to modify the composition 
of the images, and the fonts used in the text will vary between possible versions. 

 

Thus, the e-dream is  formed for the  user by merging  the images he chose through the 
selection made in the word search and the phrases he wrote earlier. From there, it is at the 
user's  discretion  to  recreate  an  e-dream  randomly  using  the  elements  of  that  same 
navigation or going back to the beginning of the process to make other options for reports 
and word choices. It is also possible to disable the display of the text on the formed image 
annd download the created e-dreams, either to just keep these images with you or to share 
them digitally.
