:
Non Infinite Stories© is a system that uses digital combinatorial processes, specific narrative rules and
optimization of works fragmented into nodes or short narrative blocks.

Generating multiple possible readings, specific to each reader with different approaches and resolutions.
This is a tool that allows the transformation/relationship of a fixed plot to a specific reconfiguration
creating a new opening, is the discourse between the user and the machine.

In the workshop, it can be explained how the system works and let all the people that attends develop
their own proposed chapter in a macro-story. Creating as a result a new way in how the stories are told
and read.

Session 1: The text (20 min)

• The Paradigm of Contemporary Narrative Structure: Explanation of the hypertext plot. How the digital
narrative and multilinearity structure works from plot twisting and climaxes changes, and how the three
Aristotelian acts in cinema and the five Elizabethan acts in television can be transformed into an
exponential form.

Analyzing the idea, the synopsis and the treatment.

• Practice: Each student will develop a proposed chapter into a predefined macro-story.

Session 2: The NIS system (20 min)

• The construction of the system: Dynamics, categories and motivation of the NIS program.

• Elements of the structure: The sequence, scenes, use of fragmented characters (from serialized novels
to digital seriality).

• Practice: Sketch of each chapter, seeing how they can interact when combined "infinitely".

Session 3: The making (60 min)

• Chapter writing and construction of the macrostructure.

• Construction, writing and rewriting with supervision and assistance.

Session 4: Publishing (20 min)

• Publishing of the works written by the ELO members in our online platform
