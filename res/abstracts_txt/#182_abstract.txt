:
I propose comparing methods of generating forensic images of 3.5 inch floppy disks in order to evaluate
methodologies for use in media archeology labs. Many key works of electronic literature (including the
bulk of Eastgate Systems, Inc. early publications) were released on 3.5 inch floppy media. I will use both
Kyroflux and Superdrive floppy disk controller units to generate forensic images and also generate
images using BitCurator suite of forensic software and using legacy computing hardware and software.

Gathering data on the quality of images created by these disparate methods and also on the workflows
involved and the ease and practicality of employing them will produce useful information for other media
archeology labs examining how the field of floppy disk forensics has advanced.

The results of these tests should show useful comparison data between the quality of the images created
from identical media, the range of image types that can be created using each technique, and the
usefulness for online access and emulation each forensic methodology and platform provides.
