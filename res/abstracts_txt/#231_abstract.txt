:
In this work, we propose to study a series of Argentine digital literature productions that problematize the
idea of property in language. We refer to practices of appropriation and expropriation that –through
copy-paste, plagiarism, remix, collage and work with “ready made”, among other operations that the
digital medium facilitates - question the triad author-authority-property. We consider that, in this
questioning of the traditional conception of authorship, these productions also allow us to read an
“epochal slippage” within the category of subject (Bürger 2001), as they propose alternative forms of
subjectivity.

In the general process of virtualization of subjects and their signifying practices, we consider that
appropriationist writing practices propose particular modes of subjectivation. In this sense, we are
interested in asking ourselves if it is possible to think in terms of mediated subjectivities, “halfway”
–between human agency and the machine–, turned into specters or turned into a “medium”, due to their
various links with technology. That is to say multiplied subjectivities, as they "make others speak" and
withdraw from the expression of their own, in a questioning of the notions of ownership and authorship.
Productions that bring multiple voices into play, while giving place to them in a single modulation.
Regarding these practices, we are interested in raising the question of whether or not they operate as
resistance to the hegemonic meanings of digital culture. In other words, if they manage to escape the
binary logics of the technolinguistic standardization systems and the segmentation of profiles, which tend
to reduce the subjective to what is offered “to be captured as data” (Kozak).
