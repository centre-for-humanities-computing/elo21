:
Populated Solitude

Encounters, between the interior and exterior. The between-two of solitude.

An awkwardness, the combinations, probabilities, frailness, charm, and style arising from the
communication and encounters during the COVID pandemic. Movements, ideas, events and people
constantly move in a zig zag effect that happen as interaction takes place. There is an a-parallel
evolution, a result of an encounter “to find, to capture” (Deleuze and Parnet 1987, 7).

Solitude populated with encounters which are always becoming. Movements, ideas, events, people in a
zigzag effect happening in an a-parallel evolution, the double capture, a connection.

Capture is always a double-capture, that which creates not something mutual, but an asymmetrical block,
an a-parallel evolution. Always ‘outside’ and ‘between’ (Deleuze and Parnet 1987, 7).

This is the encounter. The becoming. We are not just one thing, not just a musician, not just a local
resident, not just an artist, but an entire production studio.

The block starts gathering momentum.. It no longer belongs to anyone, it is ‘between’ everyone. Chance
will turn up following inspiration from something. A ‘pick-up’, rather than a ‘cut-up’. I propose to research
the location, the people who were part of its history, to find any records, any photos, any memories still
held by people around the town. To facilitate this collection there will be a call for participation on social
media.

The creation of a collection of sound, vision and text will result in a performance using content with an
online presence and a physical presence.
