These existential effects led to my creation of a visualyl narratological immersive experience entitled
Confinement Spaces, which consisted of 3D scans and renders of the UAE quotidian landscape, first of
places immediately around me. But as I was able to expand my tr avels, more spaces were scanned in,

Navihedron interface regime.

In Confinement Spaces, six months of expanding explorations into iconic spaces of the United Arab

the 3D scans.

All of these elements (technological collapse of space and time, the freezing of existence into a timeless
space, and all of these spaces collapsed in to a form of momentary narrative are consistent with my
studies of spatial narratology and form as proposed by Joseph Frank. In this paper, I wish to discuss the
spatiality of pandemic time, the similarities of Covid time to Joyce and Proust, and the modes in which
Confinement spaces develop these ideas.
