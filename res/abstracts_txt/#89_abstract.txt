More than 20 years after their publication web-based hypertexts such as Hegirascope or The Unknown
are available, read and viewed just as intended on their publication date. “Html and a bit of Javascript” or
“Javascript and a bit of html”, in case of Web based text generators such as Taroko Gorge, seem to
constitute the best formula for creating long-lasting e-literature. Any platform, old or new, which supports
exporting to html improves not only the longevity of the work, but can also bring it new life on any platform
in the future. Flash, celebrated for its user-friendliness and accessibility, did not follow this path.
Storyspace, infamous for its cost and its role in propagating commercial circulation of e-literature, did! All
of its versions starting from 1.5 included a support for open formats in form of html export (although by
default in limited form).

The workshop demonstrates the future direction of the in-house development environment used for
translation and migration of Michael Joyce’s afternoon.a story (2011) and Twilight. A Symphony (2015)
into browser/online ports and translations. The framework has been currently updated to its third edition
which – apart from its support for guard fields, roadmaps, link scripting – introduces form-based import
layer and mobile friendly visualizations of Storyspace Map Views based on D3.js JavaScript library. In
fact, the library allows for visual representations of any connections between html elements. As such, the
platform is evolving into a toolkit for linguistic and media translation of any e-elit work that enables html
export. During the workshop a workflow of importing the work, processing its metadata, and preparing the
linking system for the visualization module will be demonstrated and analysed.

The hypertexts used during the workshop are: Izme Pass by C. Guyer, M. Joyce, and M. Petry; WOE by
M. Joyce, and The Life of Geronimo Sandoval by S. Ersinghaus.
