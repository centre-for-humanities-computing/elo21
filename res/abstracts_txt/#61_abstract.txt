:
The Algorithm of Donated Dreams is a sociotechnical artifact and a piece of computational poetry.

It is the product of a speculative design experience for the blockchain community DAOstack and the
Reshaping Work Barcelona conference in 2019.

It is also published in Taper 04 and is live here: https://taper.badquar.to/4/

Guests who participated in its making went through a game of futures to speculate "What if we lived in a
society where we donated dreams like we donate blood? And what if those dreams were inserted in an
algorithm that made us see we can build that society?".

Through our game, guests found challenges in that future society and prototyped solutions first with
objects around them and then with language.

There were two experiences to arrive to the algorithm:

Online: https://thetimetravel.agency/The-Algorithm-of-Donated-Dreams

The code for the algorithm was taken from a tiny computational poem at Taper.
