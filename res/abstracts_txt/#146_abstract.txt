This talk shares collaboration strategies and “funnest practices” for using netprov — networked
improvisation, online roleplay literature — in the classroom. In sequences of “jump right in” creative
games, students explore such topics as character development and character voice in a real-time
laboratory of quick creative exchanges (accompanied by mutual encouragement and laughter). By
building a bridge between students’ own social media writing practices and learning about historic
literature, their creative strategies are expanded and critical connections between canonical texts and
contemporary, everyday writing are made. What students may not realize is that netprov also can help
break through their own creative blockages and freezes.
