Resembling at times a two-person show, the cellphone play is a dramatic genre that usually involves two
characters: "you", the assumed texter, who tends to be the primary character, and a textee, who tends to
be the secondary character, and whose identity is usually only indicated by whatever the primary
character has named them in their phone. While cellphone screen caps are often treated as a type of
fact-event in public discourse, the cellphone play genre opens up this cross-platform approach to the
potentials of composing fiction. This paper offers an exploration of cellphone plays that are roughly 6-12
screencaps in length created by student artists during the 2020-21 academic year, along with artistic
statements discussing the artists' intentions for each piece. The cellphone play genre offers a
performative practice to bring two people together to create fiction in these COVID times of digital
distance.
