This paper reflects on Electronic Literature projects I created between 2017 and 2020 through
interrogating how each project collaborates with an increasingly complex non-human component. Riffing
off of Donna Haraway's concept of "significant otherness" and making kin, I speculate on the differences
in the significance of the otherness that is engaged with in projects using methods based on
combinatorics/chance, statistical models, and vector semantics (contemporary neural-network based
language models like GPT-2). While recognizing that each approach involves a reduction in human
agency, this reflective paper focuses on the increasing complexity to which this agency is relinquished
and how to deal with presenting this relationship between human and non-human actors. Culminating in a
series of projects using OpenAI's GPT-2, the need for a self-reflexive "transformative reading interface" is
introduced as a concrete instantiation of Katherine Hayles' concept of a "technotext." A transformative
reading interface links a corpus of text to text generated by a language model based on that corpus. Such
an interface serves to provide a source of noisy creativity for writing and a way to explore the materiality
of contemporary language models for reading, while interrogating and respecting the posthuman nature of
these artifacts.
