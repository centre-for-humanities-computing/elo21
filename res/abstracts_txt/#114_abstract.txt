Video games are mirrors to our contemporary reality that reflect our society's philosophies, rhetoric, and
more. Published in 2013, BioShock: Infinite offered a glimpse into the reality of a Utopian America ruled
by conservative far-right identity politics. In 2016, Donald Trump's election as the 45th President of the
United States brought to the forefront of America what is often ignored. In this essay, I argue what Utopia
is to the far-right by analyzing the society of Columbia, the use of media in the state, and more. Overall, I
argue that politics and ideas of Utopia can be simulated into video games to understand far-right
narratives of Trumpian politics better.
