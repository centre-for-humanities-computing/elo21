This presentation aims to reflect on two labels that have been used to define sets of artefacts born out of
the same context but evoking different connotations. I refer to the terms “post-internet” and “post-digital”.

Both terms allude to a post-stage, a leap that announces a cultural shift, perceived by artists but difficult
to pinpoint and demarcate with precision, a prefix that might refer to ‘after’ (chronologically) as well as
‘beyond’ (spatially); often used to highlight that what has been superseded is the novelty and
exceptionality of the internet and digital technology. Actually, these terms address the fact that digital
media is no longer a form of mediation but it has become our ontology, though this new form of being is of
such a diffuse, complex and assembled nature, not even Haraway could have anticipated it.

Triggered by impulses of excess and overindulgence, on the one hand, or sustainability and preservation,
on the other, post-internet and post-digital art emerge from a networking and tech-savvy sensibility that
has altered the relation between artist, audience, and art object.

In particular, I am going to focus on the work of artists that use Instagram as an art gallery for exhibiting
their work (Almudena Lobera, Johanna Jaskowska, Lucy Hardcastle) or to sabotage the platform from the
inside (Amalia Ulman, Joshua Citarella). Bearing a family resemblance to electronic literature, these
works also explore the narrative process in the construction of an artist’s identity, the changing territories
of human-machine/artist-spectator interactions and digital-analogue materializations. The art objects they
produce can be classified as “phygital”, physical/digital constructs that inhabit, in a myriad of different
possibilities of mediation and convergence, the physical and the digital spaces.

As artists explore the platform’s potential as exhibition space, advertising site, and conversation aisle,
their phygital objects reflect the tensions between a nostalgia for an analogue craftsmanship which rebels
against machinic perfection and an interrogation of human creativity that propels us into the future
through an ever more profound symbiosis with our technological habitus.
