The global COVID-19 pandemic has made me further address the value that artistic research has for our
mental and psychological health and its significance in community healing. I have, for a while now, used
digital technologies to create poetic spaces of shared personal stories interconnecting narratives to bring
up issues of power, territory, displacement, historical memory, gender and violence. The need to live,
work, socialise at a distance, through digital platforms has highlighted the importance of finding ways to
share stories, connect and heal through community creative research practice. How can we engage
global communities through electronic literature art practices?

This paper will explore the use of digital methods and tools to conduct and disseminate research in
interdisciplinary projects alongside artists and communities and will address the motivations to
researching with participants. It will draw from the findings coming up from our workshop in ‘Creative
Digital Practices: Community Platform for Healing and Mapping’, (also submitted to the ELO conference).

As co-investigator of the AHRC funded project Memory, Victims, and Representation of the Colombian
Conflict my role was leading the creative team working on the artistic research project titled Invisible
Voices: Women Victims of the Colombian Conflict and give voice to the women in their participation in the
construction of memory. This was an enriching experience where both parties - the academics/artists and
the community group – gained knowledge through the physical co-creative workshops with tailored
designed research methods for this specific context, and the subsequent digital documentation and
archival of the artistic experience. Taking this project and others as core studies, this paper will address
questions in connection to community research; the value of creative storytelling and artistic approaches
to share personal stories; and discuss pertinent issues in connection to the value, impact and societal
change these projects can contribute, not only to the specific group, but to society in general.
