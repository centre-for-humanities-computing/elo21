Oneirografia is an interactive digital work that proposes a reflection on the role of dreams in our lives.
Created from research initiated in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the work began with internet
searchers on a particular dream. Subsequently, this creative process became an investigation into the
atavistic relationships that the human species maintains with dreams and observed the different
meanings that this state of mind has acquired throughout our history.

Oneirografia is inspired by dream experiences and allows the user to navigate in a 3D environment. Into
this environment, is possible to receive the message of the oracle, which is a combinatorial poem. In
addition, the user can make up his e-dreams. Composed of the choices made during navigation,
e-dreams mix images, filters, and text. It is possible, from there, to save the formed images or share
them.
