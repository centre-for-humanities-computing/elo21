Video games and their associated forms stand as the most lucrative entertainment sector on the planet,
dominating other forms of visual media in dollars generated annually. In the proposed paper, adapted
from a dissertation chapter, I will draw upon my experience as a game designer to illuminate the
increasingly dire ways that various actors in the political sphere – from online trolls all the way to world
leaders – have combined the language and techniques borne from the industrial practices of game design
with the power of social media and other online communication platforms to produce new forms of
disinformation, propaganda and conspiracy theory. In this paper, I will trace the history of a specific form

of game – the Alternate Reality Game (ARG), from its early literary history in 1903 to its modern
incarnations. Subsequently, by harnessing lessons from my own work developing ARGs for the 2016
video game Frog Fractions 2 and the 2020 film Dared My Best Friend, I will examine how closely the
principles employed during ARG marketing campaign have been in similar use in American politics since
the 2016 American presidential campaign, culminating in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capital. I
will discuss how modern totalitarian systems will almost certainly continue to refine and deploy these
strategies in the future as a new, dangerous form of propaganda: one that lives primarily in online
discussion platforms and, much like the narrative of an ARG, is constructed both unwittingly and
collaboratively by the targets of the propaganda themselves. Finally, I utilize my experience both as a
designer and online community manager to address how, especially during COVID-19 quarantine, these
emerging risks can be combated as the daily intersection of digital and analogue worlds continue to
merge ever closer.
