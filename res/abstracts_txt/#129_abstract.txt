The paper is devoted to the reading and critical reflection of the generated electronic literary texts. From
the structural point of view all textones of generated texts can be divided into standard schemes or
patterns (word combinations or the whole sentences that are switched according to the software
algorithms). Authors use these schemes to make generated texts close to the natural human language. If
we look closer, for example, at elit twitter bots, most of their twits look like meaningful expressions. But
what makes them meaningful and what kind of meaning can readers get from these patterns? Is it

possible to catch the esthetic idea of the whole generated work analyzing these verbal patterns? One of
the strategies to reveal the author’s aesthetic concept of the generated work is to identify the key words
grid of the separate textone as well as of the whole work. The key words grid allows to catch the thematic
dominant and then move to the interpretive strategies of the whole literary work.

For example, the “Sea and Spar between” by N. Montfort, S. Strickland contains the following verbal
patterns: [noun] / [noun + less – verb Past Simple – verb Past Simple] / [noun] / [nailed] to the [noun] and
[How to withstand the jay pink course] / [nailed to the – noun / object] / [verb + preposition / on] / [noun!
noun!]. The refrains in these verbal patterns signify the thematic grid of the work. The lexemes that form
the thematic grid include groups of nouns with the meaning of a large space (e. g. time; sky; eternity). The
second group includes both nouns and verbs with the semantics of space restriction (e. g. coffin; nailed
to). The third group is formed by predicates with the meaning of an incentive to an action aimed at getting
out of a closed space (e. g. wheel on; plunge on; loop on). The first two lines in the first scheme contain
calls for action directed outside (e. g. Costumeless turn and climb). The lines in the second scheme
implement the semantics of attachment, inability to leave a particular place (e. g. nailed to a coffin). To my
mind, these verbal patterns correlate with an idea of contrast in general. The vast space (it is compared in
the work with the infinity of the sea, sky, the virtual space of the WWW) is contrasted with the isolation of
a particular person. Interpretive tactic in this case is like the haiku interpretation, when the first line is used
as a keyword (a seasonal word in haiku). The next two lines are deployed within a single sentence. The
last line is a metaphor. The textones generated in "Sea and Spar between" are easy to be structured that
allows readers to identify the set of meanings. The readers involvement in the interpretational process is
one of the immutable conditions of electronic generative art.
