In this workshop we will bounce about in the egg carton of zoom and experiment with ways to dissolve the
6th wall (the camera) (the other 5 being: the 3 walls of the room and the 2 side walls of the image frame)
through collaborative story and through dance and physical performance. Building on the practice of
netprov — internet improv, online roleplay narrative — we will use words and movement to explore those
zones of video meeting practice that have yet to coalesce into social norms: awkward beginnings, sudden
disappearances, background guests, dropped connections, mis-timings, garbles, and lags. Each of these
can lead to narrative. We also will build on art history and comics to experiment with ways to make the
platform’s grid echo and expand shared visual traditions, or, comically, to play against them. We will share
and co-create methods and moments you can apply in art and education.
