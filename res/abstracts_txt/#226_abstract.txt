This poster presentation summarizes the interactive narrative designs of a historical series of significant
works of interactive cinema, from Kinoautomat (1967) to Bandersnatch (2018). It focuses on comparison
and contrast of the graph or flowchart representation of the interactive choice structure for each work,
whether highly constrained or expansive, highlighting points of comparison and contrast.

Visualization of each works and data on their choice structure is based on upcoming contributions to the
Transverse Reading Gallery project, which maps interactive plot structures across form and media from
the 1920s to the present starting with the print gamebooks of the Demian Katz Archive.
