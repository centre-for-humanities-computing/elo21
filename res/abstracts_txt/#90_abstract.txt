In the United States, a student in the 20th percentile reads books for 0.7 minutes per day, while a student
in the 98th percentile reads 65 minutes per day (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1998). For the last four years,
with 300 children from Title 1 schools and the Boys & Girls Club, we researched how to create digital
texts that better cognitively engage struggling readers using psychophysiological sensors, eye tracking,
and co-creation.

This research led to the creation of Wonder Stories. Wonder Stories’ texts motivate students to critically
think by immersing students in frequent, story-based questions. As a response to children’s low
motivations during COVID-19, we added a social competition to Wonder Stories – answering questions
correctly gave points in a trivia-like game.

When struggling readers were given Wonder Stories, students mentally showed up: their participation
increased, readers were more cognitively engaged with the material, and students were critically thinking
about the text more often. This study suggests that interactive, question-based reading shows great
promise to increasing children’s participation and engagement in middle-grade reading.
