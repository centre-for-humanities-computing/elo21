okay i think there s no area so so here i couldn t fit all hello everybody okay okay hello everyone thanks to be here and this panel i m very happy to be here so first of all let me thank once more soren and scott for this amazing conference they were able to started in a very difficult difficult period so i am very happy they were able to do this and so thanks again for this thank you so much and do other things it s amazing i m just sorry that it s the end of the semester here so i have missed some some panels and some tracks they look very interesting but i know everything has been recordso i m happy because i can check everything later so thanks again for this wonderful conference and big gap for the job done i went to say this clearly and loudly or okay so this panda well let me let me share the screen like this we can we can ready ready start about my while our panel and let s see if everything works properly is this what you should be able to see it right now so here you go tell me if you see it no that s the end that s not to do it let s start from the beginning okay now it is ok so this is january in bits critical thinking and pattern recognition was a triangle which is your platform so there is five of us we are all members of research group that i m honored to direct m a studies based at university off here you vascular and phil lynch and i m very happy that we planted this this is a few months ago and in fact a topic dan racing forcing said i m very very happy we were into the topic of before it came compound popular so it s the wow alice stopped opening department and talk and i ve done this with with my well they are all good friends so say my colleagues but actually she s a very good friend of mine earlier mazda so i will first talk and then i would pass her the talk and then it will be maya that unfortunately she sent us the video and this is one topic that we should also discuss the problematic be moms having to works and being a conference and then there will be as soon and then em on units but i m enjoying it rosario about manyof you already know you need to have quite a lot and while i ll introduce the red you know earlier earlier mais la she she s a specialist on latin american electronic literature and she s focusing right now on on on women and latin american elites the gender issue there and she collaborates a lot with digital the center of digital culture in mexico and she s based in mexico right now she got a very prestigious scholarship from the government of mexico and now she has to pay them back she so she s she has to be basedthere so that s it briefly then i will introduce maya and as but just not to twist time so why we came up with this idea well everything i have to say thank you also to maria and car because everything start with her and another couple of women in in buffalo many many many years ago in another interesting elite conference there was actually a poetry at the time and we actually were discussing dash do we re not too many parlance we just women and in fact now it s totally different i m very happy to god and the picture that you see that you see here i was taken in another conference was another report in and in in in in buenos iris and was really we opened the conference and it was just the panel and we all women and at that time was quite rare so i m very happy that in a few years things that really really changed so what we are presenting especially this first part of the of the panel is sanam going studies we have well i have started i ve started in when i got my marie curie and it was like focusing this ashley on gender and women in in in gender and we would ride was in elliot and and while you seen a while i will talk more about the europe side of the world and the north america do a lot of talk about dead yet you ll see collections and european and technology over the training literature so we also talked about that part but before things start getting into it have to take a step back because i doing this song going studies i focused a lot of bad collaboration this is something that i already presented in a paper cl conferences in portugal five years ago to say this is really something that i m working on since do i had a break because i have a baby so i talked for almost one year doing things just thinking but that s another stuff so been doing this i ve really worked on collaborations as well and see since collaboration looks to me so very it s so good it s so important in elite i also try to clarify to myself first what means to collaborate in elite so have divided in two main groups say like that so to create collaboration and and gas collaboration so gasp collaboration of those collaboration which are simply not declared and it s not so rare i meansomething that also happened in the in the in the past and with the classical and a logic goalie to jury if you want you might recognize the picture the picture here the likes of example mass and go smokey that was probably was the one the ghost rider many of the famous very famous french writer so this is this collaboration i was already existed and also discuss collaboration as always consistent bosh have tried to to see the direct kind of couple of tendencies in in in in in in la too and when it comes to declared collaboration so from from one side you have defined roles and other the other possibility of you don t youdon t have defined roles said they collaborate but you know who did was okay and if there are just two alters declare there so normally there is no real defined collaboration so they re both authors maybe even if one is just writing dead the linguistic tax and the other one is like coding or other other stoffel graphic designer designer etc if there are more than two authors that the worst done by ho show starts to be more and more clear why is that because i want to see what kind of collaborations that happens in women when women literature as well so kind to to to to do some very fast distant reading on wash up what happens in collaboration and and and women at the very beginning well this this this image that you see right now this graph here it s i would try to map out the publications about electronic literature excluding the new one that has been published last year that concerns caribbean and latin american i was trying to get you to because this is something i m working on as well but is more focusing on on oil your size that so this you see briefly howthe publication of elite works has grown quite a lot to me the lc three almost alone published almost the off of the words that were published them in the order to abc and the european and technology electronic literature so this is an ontology of electronic of european electronically to just to make it clear so briefly but what happens with women india as i m focusing i mean i have lots of this data because i ve worked on data loss i have data from the yo and data from sleep have data from the and today i mean i ve i think about i taking data from anywhere but i don t want to focus on publication because maybe not a kind of an agency and i was more curious to to show this things today so here you have a slide and maybe you see here quite clear the amount real amount this is absolute value so you have the real amount of works published in dlc one that maybe we need to remember when said and so for the tree evil sees collections so you have the de de de de amount of of of works published and then you have dose created by women or those created where at least one of the daughters was a woman so you see there are some some differences but this more interesting i think because if you look at this you see dasha the percentage of women publishing their own works is growinghas grew of course but i think the dress quite still a lot to do because you see dash just women publishing works by themselves like with a single alters for male authors or two still quite a minority compared to the rest off off dead especially especially if you if you look at the glc three you you you are happy they are growing of course they have been grown but still lots to do you know it s not the anyway anyway and i have to this this this image from the lc database to see if this was also i mean if this this minority that is still present in this also y all see the electronic the literature collection three that was publishing and in was also the same things for example on the allison database that is so important especially for for us in europe scott did a wonderful job building this out sip database it was happy to collaborate that it was the university of alaska run this big project but so i was comparing data and in fact of course that the items on on on men were much more than on on women but still especially if we consider sorry you have to go back second if we have to consider the electronic european and chinese literature well done you have to understand why there are so many words by women published there and i have to say something as well deals that the third electronic literature collection has done amazing work collecting words from everywhere in the world so from japan to china there was something missing and the very first do busting many i think and it s so important concern manyrace and to end and and invasion nationalities are missing there and of course there is a call for works but i think that maybe as a community we have to be a little bit more inclusive and consider yourself this decides and this aspects so i m collaborations again this is our absolute value so so women how we do collaborate because sometimes apparently seems that we are not able to collaborate to one another i don t know if it s left calf networks probably a better way so you see here for example in the electronic literature in european returning literature there was no collaboration between women at least no declared then there is the ghosts and other stuff that i ve said at the very beginning of this presentation so here you see in fact for example in the glc three this collaboration is a little bit growing compared to the second one don t want to take too much time lots of statistics here so today so really as statistical one so this is again on those were like absolute value this is a do some mistake here this is absolute values and this is our relatives but anyway then would have done to you have an idea of what i ve done here how i map out this this this collaboration between or among women in in electronic digital then one of my question for this ongoing study is that if there is any differences in creating elite that women are somehow bringing or showing so one things that have done it s to seeif there were like more works tagged with poetry or with narrative in this in this works and because there is a statement by virginia woolf that declares that we men prefer to write narrative to to to to to poetry because narrative is a new john that they can manipulate that we women can be productively we it is not rigorous standard datareading poetry andpush partiality or light language has differences between tags with poetry and narrative but it s a tricky thing because sometimes both both hacks exists for the same for the same work so sometimes this data should devil s been reconsider from our close reading approach now just the reading so defining quite well if that works was really blogging more to portrait or to narrative thenthe other things that have done and i want to show you that i stopped because otherwise that ticked all time for me it s i work on titles and see if there is a differences in choosing titlesin women this is something i ve like redoing like to know if you have familiar with the work by more ideas on this the readings that were like doing this with with english literature as like counting nouns continue titles see if the trend have changedin in in the years in the center is and that s what i m doing so here you have some kind of data some data so if we turned my question was like do women prefer to have single title like one word like a shot like lunch or you prefer to have more words certainly a little bit like descriptive etc you have some some some somewhere here but i will stop here because there was a big time just for myself and i would pass my i will pass the weight led medo this otherwise she cannot share here either should be you should be able no area to share your screen right okay great yes mark everything starts with maria mercy so we serve food okay everything s okay right you should sure whoops okay so well thanks everyone for being here and of course thank you you vana for organizing this panel and for bringing us all together once again i m sorry to disappoint you but i m still in bristol however i m going to be in mexico soon but still this is part of the big project i was working with the mexican grand that dimension so today i m going to continue the conversation about like how these like dendur patterns are fixing fixing the electronic digital platforms and i will tell you about the research that i am currently developing so as i mentioned my line of research is more focused on that in american electronic literature so when i began to wonder what was the role of women creators in the latin american scene i began with simple questions such as like how and when didit start and how to investigate and keep track of these contributions in the history of electronic literature so the first thing i did was of course to check what had been done about read written about it investigate it and then as diana mentioned in as we all know the influential work of medea means yeah with the addition of women take lead in wasone of the first things i read and that actually motivated me to know what was going on in the latin american scene in that sense because as you know there is a chapter there with the microbial cosa which actually researchers on like latin americanelectron digital when how and so that see that there was a spark for the investigation there and then i also want to mention that while i was at leeds in working with professor thea pittman she began the her research or latin american electronicallyto created by women created by women we should publish in and then she encouraged me and it is thanks to her and to her support that i actually you know decided to began my own investigation so i wanted to clarify that with ended up in this paper been publishedin which is like mainly focused on like latin america and it was published in texas that more having like a general geographical overview and that s what i m going to tell you about today how i develop the the research to write this paper inwhat am i doing right now so i had to of course had a look at the different databases that we are all familiar with the different collections of course the mc cultural center in mexico city s been doing to and also with two very recent and important projects from two of my colleagues catalina gangster in chile in virginia raja invested which is currently the hat like this original project which which wasto map the electronic literature written or created in chile with our initial project which was called digital culture tim and in that project it has a small section dedicated to electronic literature which i use for my research and then return hewas doing at the beginning atlas and now they are both building big databases are they actually released like both projects two weeks ago so i wanted to underline that because it was it was very important for my research and of course the other anthologies which is also important to mention here because the anthologies that you see here we re going to be difficult in they are hosted in the white by the way and argentina so it was really interesting to have all these different exchanges with them in order to see which works they considered to be electronic digital in which works were written by women were interestedfor me and of course one of the biggest i want to say achievements one of the biggest thing that i did during this year of research was to interview almost let s say women and these interviews were actually fed my research and gave me all the answers and of course like brought of nuance of what i wanted to do in the future so i did that to start and then i selected for three it works in the point in which i am right now is like in the selection of record for and then after i m going to use like a completely different theoretical framework in order to analyze what i do want to analyze in this works and then after what i m going to show you right now is just like a histogram of the of the different works and in relationship to the country and the job creation and some graphics and of course like some possible work the publication that i alreadyshared and then some a small editorial guy worked for the center of the the kosher mexico city and probably something that i would publish in libya in so the here is a histogram and here we can show how what the different colors of course are referred to the country aware of the authors and with the corresponding elite works that i chose and we can see the different how it has what there are gaps of course as we can see from and to but after we can see how things begin to move on to the how different countries begin to come into into place and into the scene and what i did to try to help me to bed was also to to put this like dashed lines through you know like for example for the release of flash so to see how many of the words were programming flash and how many of them use it to them and how many they were stored in celebrations so that really helped me to create this like timeline not only of creations but also of technological apparatus that the artists were using so that s one of the things that i wanted to show you and also if you see on the other side you have this i green that red lines will show also some of our iconic authors that i had also had in mind which had mainly men because one of my let s say of the deep so for the future is also to do our compared to the story right which will be more interesting in that sense and okay so then after that i m going to show you these other graph that i were working on so basically this graph that shows isthe relationship between the general very of the artist and the year and the age of first creation so when i was doing these interviews one of the questions was like when did you created your first electronic literary work the when they answered that i was doing this a small database in order to plot this graph and i discovered different things that i m going to talk about all that right now but i just wanted to tell you that they it depends on the time frame in this case i divided up by by decades so it depends on which they could you want to investigate and and analyze and who is actually who was creating the first work during those those years so another good question will be is like what s going to happen in the future because as you can see at the end of the graph you have like the actors that is or so that that s that s a the demon of the graph but you also have another one that is years old that was born between so of course this data as i said is based only on the women that i chose but that s why it s also important to consider like the new words that other people have been doing now because one of my goalsto it s to apply this methodology to the new anthology of latin american and caribbean electronic literature and also to the two databases of the clinics i previously mentioned and just to wrap it up because i know we re in a rough time is like youknow of course i mean as i said i need to expand the database for my research i in the interviews i have also faced all these challenges so for digital obsolescence as we as we all know so what s also important to learn how the artists are like preservingtheir own work or are working in collaboration with institutions or centers of digital culture to preserve their own worth and how we how they are facing these new that obsolescence and then another thing that i wanted to mention is that of those i want to underline that because now i have i m working with other numbers continue to create electronic literature wasn t which is also interesting to see what has been the development of those artists in those let s say four years and then of course we have at the beginning of the strong presence of argentina argentina brazil and chile which has also you know like some connections with like for example with brazil with the relationship with concrete poetry so we can alsotalk about that maybe and then another thing is the the first that through the interviews i did not discover but ii realized who were the first like latin american elite translators that in this case was from english to portuguese and also like other languages were involved in this whole creation of faces which also is like english and french and another important thing was that the impact that artistic residences have especially in the decades or i think it was in the s how important it was for artists in latin america to to go and develop works during their artistic residences and just to the last question is for the graph like you know there is a tendency that shows that they are dispersed age of the at this age of first creation of a lot of work decreases by five years it s like it so i will finish with that so we can continue with the other presentations and once again thank you for bringing us together and thanks to the yellow for the space to share my research and cuna well yeah very interesting indeed so now we have a video you should be able to see it it s a maya they ll be there she teaches at the university comprehensive university in madrid and while she s very interested in in in feminist studies so she she she she s a specialist on that especially for for english electronically to to let my or talk you can see the screen right okay yay do you think you need to share this some oh i didn t see you can t see the screen okay you can t hear but we cannot hear you our gosh dan dan i will interrupt it because i can hear so no probably okay you know i shared the sound i shared everything but probably something doesn t work please yes but it s already solved there you go for the electronic literature organization conference of these year post pandemic i m going to give my conference entitled closely enough stephanie strickland scintilla sankara yo and paul ryan s sleeping limbs in the close reading we have to discover how a literary texts works it consists of a reading process followed by a literary analysis there was a fine more appropriate to analyze electronic literary works are using hermeneutics to interpret the text and semiotics in order to maximize the use of science furthermore as poetry s inseparable from motion the close reading of electronic prime slipping lamps is also going to be analyzed apply in effect theoryhermeneutics is present in the study of the teton literature because computation uses signs which are both human readable and machine to bow as albert or male marcus barrel and polo fury explain humans tend to be text realized to interpret and inthe field of digital humanities and hermeneutics traced and data field in a hermeneutics approach to the digital the researcher works on the full force sofitel part of electronic literature a very thorough male introduced the concept of imaginationwithin within he instead of an ir when that human schematics asians are externalised into technologies and that human imagination has its analog in the digital dynamics of articulation between databases and algorithms important portrait sounds sound an image make it close to art what space increases the visceral contents of poetry however the visual content of poetry has always been there in your rosario words poetry and art in general have always been synonymssynonymous with subjectivity with creativity a poetry comes from the avant garde movement tradition it s already an idea novelty has even put up into question with some critics because they believe that electronic forms are only reproducing avant garde experiments however media provides new elements and electronic forms original for their themes visualizations and new ways to be manipulated by the real in digital port reports having learned from avant garde concrete and visual poetry reproduce the pleasure ofpolitical connection and in a place like the internet where the changing information is so fast some digital points propose a different relationship with time linked to the reading practice christopher funkhouser explained that part two is poetry and computer poetry the related to portray his computer poetry in prehistoric digital part repeat at therefore if an equal m cannot be analyzed like a printed one using hermeneutics semiotics effect theory it will then be enough in the cultural enough for slipping lamps the technological elements have to be also known describing to credit as partof that work i m going to allies sleeping limps how was a sleeping glimpse making process slipping glimpse is a digital kinetic verbal visual collaboration between price when employed stephanie strickland programmer senior fellows and cameo and vital refer polo ryan it was published in electronicliterature collection to edited by morris mehmet really and stephens this flesh poem is also included in women authors and cyber feminism collection created by myself if i ll be there piniella in the same knowledge base into the introduction of slipping glimpse the other explains that making this work made them newly aware of commonalities in code in poetry and in quotesin slipping links we scroll the text and we find two columns of texts that appear at the same time and the reader has to read one column and then regenerate the text again to read the older strickland and lows and make reference to what intern who coined the term homeostasis to describe the develop mental systems whose necessary path create seems to be don t to return and therefore making lips and slipping lips the water rates the pointtext the text reads image capture technologies and ryan s image capture technology with the water you offer compares reading quotes to silent reading of poetry experiences are transmitted without being said they believe in a future your thirst we live in a future in which readers can get used to lines of poetry loops of code aquatic patterns in order to read they re generating futures find and choose a life sustaining necessary path i m going to do a close read of of slipping lace slipping limbs cover presents the images which correspond to the technical segments of the point the photographs of the oceans are in different natural colors being blue green yellow and white thepredominant ones are basing your two groups it could be considered that these signifiers use only one of the five sensory channels sites their signifiers seem to be symbol although the signifies where the readers associate the chorus with can be morecomplex the signifies could be blue for calm green for peace yellow for heat and white for emptiness by clicking on one image the user finds a video with floating verses of the electronic poem which do not follow any semantic order some verses canbe read others cannot be read because our first overlaps the older or he discovered by the course of the image finally windy they stopped they can be read but as the verses do not feed into the logical meaning the public cannot be fully understood the words are watch more than bread however even if the content is not clear through images we can experience filling and energies the million doesn t needto be understood when allies in electronic poetry do you want to de rosario quoting alice s explained this intentional ambiguity of meaning according to the rosario proficiency shows the digital right increase the language from the primary of meaning open it up to the unintentional not intentional reading movement the importance of facilitation work than to poetry itself there are two ways of enjoying slipping limbs from my point of view reading what is watching the videos and floating verses and the other is clicking on scroll texts and reading the segments of the text while watching the video or the background slipping lips software tracks the motion of the water movement that occurs withineach of the videos meaning can be found in each word in a segment of our poor all segments of the chronic point container video with floating sentences which imitate handwriting i interpreted the fact that the text can be read by the handwritten text in nature cannot as the idea that we can control reading a text but we cannot control nature natural elements come and go there is a continuous movement everything flows like interactive lots pants very lucky in everything they win over us korea sanest poem images and metaphors are juxtaposed combining words irrationally my personal interpretation is that the point is explaining right in digital poetry process as caffeine in a stone where nobody has done it before slipping lips is one of the most famous works of electronic poetry due to its quality and originality as far as experimental experimentation is concerned as well as the video photography and the uniqueness of in the form of the segments of the poemin the research field of electronic literature dark republicans have close riddance it will be positive to encourage junior as well senior researchers to lose fear of the new technologies and avant garde electronic literature because supporting ourcommentary contemporary writers and artists will be useful as a contribution to the future academics in order to better understand the literary production of our times not only at the commercial level as it happens with printed literature bestsellersor nobel prize winners but also to support the production distribution and a study of alternative ways of producing literature electronic politics should mature as the tools for making it evolved and our future analysis and interpretations as alsoincrease in quantity and quality thank you very much for listening and watching bye bye thank you for this interesting talk and close reading now we have another close reading by as soon love is very law she also teach so she s associate professor of the consultants in the madrid and while she has done so many things that she s also the director of international research group at the comprehensive imagery that is called the same ad blocker bo bo like this we don t waste time and as soon i ll shut up and you talk sorry i couldn t find the word mike was to turn it on and i hope you can hear me now you can you hear me yes perfectly awesome great okay thanks all right i m going to try to go fast because my my was is a long presentation basically and a well what am i trying what i am trying to do recently is i m researching and i m assuming edition so and i work on intermediate semiotics and cognition so recently i m exploring and identity of ways to materiality and is in display in this case of course electronic literature and art and how do they interfere with them or other forms of material human materiality so to say so i am i have chosen and and the work of these very famous australian net artist and game designer miss breeze and she s also a member of this activist group known as the third faction and where she explores from a critical perspective and exposes demonicnarratives and attitudes that generally pervade game environments so we will see that she merges and gender aspects also in car and in her work know so because of time limitations i m going to look very briefly at four point anthropocene entrepreneurs theme and and the collection of the verses in d and which is a collaboration with very well known electronic literature artists some of them actually in unprecedented in this in this panel and the the underlying hypothesis as i have already mentioned is that net art might actually enhance and readers understanding of key aspects related to criticalissues as well as encourage public engagement with those issues and in particular with regards to human and non human actions in the anthropocene and in terms of theory and methodology i use actor network theory and extended human approaches i m not going to have time to go into these in great detail in the presentation today but they re they re backing my research so first with regards to her poem anthropocene and troubleshooting i won t go into the detail of analyzing it you have it down below there on the screen and in she published this book which is called human readable messages messenger where she talks about this type of code work which she uses in this poem and also in this book to write it s a kind of a diary no and and and she has this questionon the on the back cover of the book and what did you get if you stitch together standardized literary conventions think the monumental output of bill shakespeare and the staccato portions of emily dickinson which called politics steeped in digitally drenched communication so basically this is what she s trying to do merge code work and different forms of code work and human languages and also later in other of her works in particular sorry to interrupt you just you just you forgot to put slide presentation so you saw all your slides but you don t we don t have the big one on your phone on our face so if you can put yeah you don t have the big i jumped on a son yo yo what what you don t have we don t you we have all your slides you have to to to do to push the present tachyon and okay yes you guys is that okay well actually i didn t forget but it s easier to me to follow track of what s coming but it s no problem i just i just improvise okay so okay so the boy and it s the anthropocene under percent was publishing the new york in the network or life journal and it s an example of a messenger with bracketing okay so when we have having time to explore it and you have it here below and basically it it talks about the effects of anthropocene and and the term it refers as you all know to the geological time when humanity is coming and a huge impact on on the environment it was a term that was coined by chemist poor kristen and marine biologist eugene stormer and and and it also emphasizes to a certain extent not just human impact on the planet but also encounters with non human agents and it with regards to the from the semiotic point of view to kind of interactions and interactions thatthat occur between organisms and their environment so this is all highlighted in in this point which i m not going to explore and and and just to clarify that the category of the non human includes biological forums like animal plans microorganismsor whatever but also non biological entities such as machines or artificial intelligence and you have you will see that mice like also our providing pictures of v versus you know for example in this case the author is her meds risk herself and it sit s to face right face victim holder and so when what is she doing in these verses and she s linking humans animals inanimate objects and the points i like metamorphic and and we have all the time like the anthropocene as a scene you know and this is also emphasized in in the in the point thati mentioned the anthropocene if you ve noticed the the term how she plays with the scenery the scene everything that s visualized know and as a as a performative playable scenario beyond the human non si si insisting this scenic dimensions and this was also an inquiry into the post ontology of knowledge and cognition and related to the acquisition of alphabetic language in the case of the messenger because she s breaking alphabetic language and this disruption of the reading experience which in the v vs she achieves because you can click on the different numbers and read and not just in in one line format but in different four lines like hypertext obviously these are supposes epistemologicalquestions inquiring to the notion of interpretation and explanation and how many and if meaning is only uni vocal or is it multi vocal no and so when she explains where she got the idea for a messenger and she mentioned in this interview for the soma in and she mentions that she wants to a sorry i just click on the ok she wants to open up poetic aspects okay and create a kind ofdimensional interplay combining the lyrical and like formalized structures of code okay and she uses in in the anthropocene point for example she uses bracketing and this bracketing functions like semiotic cues that invite diverse meanings if they break the word and they multiply the meanings and and she also mentioned that this idea originated from a horse populations of the work by vi n matrix matrix and andand they re mixing of game aesthetics and rq feminism and visual online engagement so you know that this vm matrix was one of the first cyber feminist groups and they very strong gender approach which of course matches our panel today gender in beats and here is for example reverse power barking and the author is herself and he and she uses messenger bracketing the words and and multiplying the meanings and these are other example because many verses are address to the question of women and women power this one is her ribbon flip by andrea phillips and breeze herself and this one is number artemisia known by nature and you can see the images also how she s questioning gender stereotypes and also fusing human image with animal like entities and also all the kind of objects in non human in general and this one is not and number bridal day by ria myers and this one is basement by scott rapper and again playing with metal objects a female connected sticks and and this ambiguity of between the human and the non human and and i in this slide i just point out that this the mechanisms she uses are similar to what victor s lawsky in art as technique and a label they familiarization if you remember and the purpose was to remove the automatism of perception and cognition and to raise cognitive awareness of how knowledge is produced by means of language now it was a technique that was using early th century modernism in art and later in data and culture jamming and it s also in a way related to sigmund freud s notion of the uncanny which of course emerges in many of her v vs okay so and a little bit about god work and how it works and and a you know it seems to me also that code would the way she introduces god work at least reminiscent of a reminiscent of other techniques used to subvert power structures in alphabeticlanguage and and examples are lewis carroll james joyce william burroughs a and in particular like in the electronic revolution borrows uses the metaphor of languages virus and that is spreads by means of institutionalization and demonic structures and the the idea behind bars cut up was to actually break these kind of order of things in in info cos words no so almost like messenger is almost like an inoculation of a small portion of pharma con in in the terms of dairy died you know which is both a vaccine or an antidote but also a poison not that incorporates political antigens in order to subvertthe infection of power so and we have a couple of quotations there from szymanowski and also from john kelly who have actually talked about how the digital art and do have a grammar of polish and there is a politics of code behind the use of codework and other programming structures in electronically to turn on net art and so as i said her points seem to produce a kind of virus like infection at various levels and they mobilize for yeses and the aesthetic the ontological and epistemological and in her poems the humans meet non human agents and there are thesekind of interactions that i was talking about which are signal by markup language or in the case of the v vs by you know the numbers that you click and you can organize in the reading and structure that you prefer and so this indicates this relax that moon nothing bre x six that everything is a product of the actions of the agents doing performing and this symbiotic interchange and and this is a kind of a sort of a sort of more diverse process ontology you know and we have a quotation there from anda bruno latour who is one of the participants or or in in in material terry s and he says that this entrepreneur for anthropomorphic expressions must be taken not figuratively by literally really a matter of defining the human enterprise form andmore first of a non human and deciding on the limits of the freedom lottery is one of the first who begins to explore and the the impact of artifacts in our life at technological machines and so on now and we have here a lovely picture of reverse one and by mark marino i don t i m trying to go fast because i don t i don t even realize how much time i have left but anyway she calls these story boxes and i was inspired by the idea of the pandora books of course the in greek mythology you open the jar and all kinds of horrible things are liberated these spirits and they create great suffering and distress for humans but basically it like the metaphorthat i was using before the virus you know she her work is like a virus or a pandora blocks that you know makes us realize you know it makes us come to terms with the things that need to be changed or that are we are not aware of the created thisidea of estrangement know and and one key aspect also in the case of pandora books that has to do with gender aspects of course is also the question of the responsibility because also in the pandora story as an evil story in the biblical story and it s always a woman who is to blame for not taking responsibility for for failing to do something no so the whole thing is i interpret her versus as i relocation of the blame and responsibility and to the reader user you know to make the readeruser become engaged in global problems that we have today and of course you can see for example this one by michael mike wire you know where the economy graffiti the images are resembling not just artificial intelligent robots but also by organismslike the cell no so there is this fusion metamorphic fusion in all four works and this is carved by jeremy hide and again just to mention that the the verses can be manipulated and reconfigure that are not just the sequence but also you can scale you can rotate you consuming so this opens and different fractal levels of recombination not just with words but also with the way you can manipulate the verses and so this one for example a curve i use this way image because i m talking about this zooming in zooming out but you also have that this one form for movie elation where you ll get the same feeling of a how a you can manipulate this works in order tocome to awareness of particular aspects of the relationship between the human and the non human and also a another thing i have to interrupt to that i have to be moderator now you have one minutes becausei think i m almost finished i don t know but almost anyway she the way they writing is using the stories as well it creates like almost like a fundamental aspect of contemplation so i was here and referring to hospitals practice of heuristic reduction but i don t have time to in this one for it and this is my last slide so i m really lucky in this one you can see like the it s almost like a kind of open there you know so this mixture of objects artifacts human non human animals and and sometimes even gloss and stuff and here have two quotations or two authors who might find useful one is jane bennett in her work vibrant matter what she s talking aboutabout the agency of inanimate things how things are apparently like stone or something and they they can rust for example they have agency they can create an impact in the anthropocene and it and also the we have reading the quotations that youi m also the we have reading the quotations that you have there because we don t have time a lambda smaller for is from oxford he s a doing cognitive archaeology and he s a fascinating author in and the which he s trying to explore how cognition alsoemerges from the manipulation of material aspects know what he calls material engagement not and and you have the coordination there is not simply in the brain it happens in the interaction between the brain and the things know so i think this was my last slide so thank you very much for your attention i m sorry i went on a little bit too long this is the summary of what i have presented and these are my references so thanks very much and they asking for your paper so that s ok so now just to be to be quick because i want to have too much time for
