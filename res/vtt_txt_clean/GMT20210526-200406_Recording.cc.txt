my name is astrid insulin and i have with me already nick regard maurice bizarre steep hasn t kramer and we re going to be oh recording stopped okay and we re going to be performing on acting a platform critical collaborative analysis of catherine s pre web story space hypertext in small and large pieces and i was going to share my screen so this is this is that this is us and this is also the cover of this beautiful story space hypertext and i have to say that you know casper did the everything the self including the the arch which is quite amazing and i hope she will tell us a bitabout that later so the work was originally published in issue of the escape quarterly review hypertext became bundled with kathy max and natural habitats and it kind of appeared in this in this folio you know format pertaining to inch floppy disk school mac and pc and later also as a single cd rom requiring two megabytes of ram and hard disk drive the work was written in storage space one point or a and used kilobytes it s really you know space and link heavy very very dense feelings and to access the work in its original format historical machines like a macintosh classic or performer are required however there are other platforms on which detects can be rendered and emulated including for example escapes to the books and emulatelike windows xp emulators like the oracle vm virtual box so in our individual contributions will be focusing on these three hardware and software constellations and their individual aesthetic and audit of ordinances together we will explore the ways in which reading the same work in different technological environment yields platform specific analytical nuances and how collectively these readings open up new forms of collaborative connective textual st herself will reflect on the genesis of the work and the wider context of its creation and she ll also respond to the other presentations in the panel in a way that feels gaps and opens up why in a debate surrounding hypertext aesthetics and historiansization so we hope that our joint work will deepen our understanding of how platform conscious readings can shed light on discrepancies between reader experience and original design and intent and how contemporary technologies might make it possibleto bring back an opposite lesson to work our panel will explore how platform studies can operate in chronically and die chronically especially if combined with post pandemic forms of remote collaboration and presentation that enables scholars to readfrom their own site specific premises so we ll we ll start with some introductory notes from katherine and then we ll have dini i think then you ll be reading from a macintosh for my site right yeah the performer do you have a classic or i have the reversals up so we re going to be easy around the reversal yes yes which we did on on a classic i think and marius will then bebe looking at in the box and i will then show will reflect a little bit on my virtual box emulation experience and then customer will come back and we will then open the floor for questions and discussion okay so i will probably just stop share at this point and turn it over to catherine now can you spotlight me because i don t want to share screen i just want to be in the middle of the screen it s a procedure called spotlighting so you would put me in the go to speaker view so just go to speaker view and i should show up that way okay if you re asked if you can do speaker view on yours and might work for catching her and you to catherine yes okay speaker view okay there we go all right that is i still see i see i see you i mean yeah i think depends on who s speaking though you know the camera will pick up whoever is speaking okay so i m in the early s i was teaching science fiction writing in cambridge massachusetts and along with david hartwell and we were summoned east get systems by sarah smith to meet mark bernstein to find out about this new thing of hypertext fiction because sir i had king space coming out and they wanted me to see stories space and that s what we could write about it in the new york review science fiction and we had a jolly time we were there for a few hours and i went home with a copy of storage space and began to play with it and that is sort and i at the time i was a graduate student in german literature at columbia and so i played with it i worked on in small and large pieces doing you know doing a lot of the linking on the train to and from manhattan sort of like doing embroidery except making links on an early mac laptop and i had this hand scanner that i think i bought it a mac world in boston that would do various things with so in addition to scanning straight i would move it around to get some text effects which are visible in there and one of these sort of iconic image sort of things of my life is this this one this actually i used to have to have these this is a ceramic alice a disney alice that came with a watch when i was about years old i guess i m the watch must havebroken so that i must have gotten another one because i used to have to and i can tell them apart because one is missing hand but when i was unpacking some things today to get ready for this this was in the box so i thought i would share miss alice with you was on the title page i m also a difference between the two reversal and now is when we did the reversal i was in toronto where i have recently been a graduate student in strategic foresight and innovation at oak at university which is an art art university and about two weeks ago we did a rather difficult border crossing and we are now in westport new york and because of that i have access i will sneak over and look look what i have i have mackintosh and it has its own large pieces on it i have the thing with all the contents that you were just shown and some floppy disks so now if we were to do with reversal today it would not have that long long ridiculous lag but i still have the the technology and instead of us so it s not like i have the time portal over there and the clot set up in the closet and i guess one of the things preparing for this it was brought home to me the thematic so the passage of time not not just the passage of time in the last years since i wrote it but the passage of time since i was last in this house which was months earlier and i had to deal with various nice living and dead in this room in order to set this up anyway so i went i i first i began to write story and story space and then i ran away and joined the circus i dropped out of columbia graduate school and went to work for mark bernstein and worked in his basement and i had an absolute blast being as the hypertext fiction editor i was writing hypertext fiction i was the bookstore sales representative i was the graphic designer and i totally redesigned the packaging so that it s my i think it s a small and large pieces maybe the first one that had the card stock or cardboard i m a package rather than plastic ones that came before them but i use mine as sort of the prototype for the redesign of the packaging and the purpose of that redesign was that i could walk into bookstores and say this is a book and have it looked plausibly more like a book than the packaging mark had before and why would walk into bookstores and i would say this is a book and they would explain what it was and they said well no people can t possibly read and chopped up text like this and now in we get up in the morning or wake up in the middle of the night and we open our phones and we read twitter which is much more chopped up than than anything i did anyway so um the other thing i want to sort of lead you to is that yeahi did that one and then i stopped partly because of you know sort of discussed at the way in which the cd rom revolution had completely crushed what we were trying to do by putting a lot of money and money into changing reader expectations around theidea that your computer experience should be as much like watching tv as possible so i m these black and white things with you know where every pixel was carefully placed and so on look i mean it s small and large pieces was out of it you know was obsolete in less time it takes to make but where i kind of went from there i m a collage art to work so i would suggest people look out if you want to see the trajectory in terms ofmy fiction am i free to go which was published by tor com or you and emulation that was published in nature um and so while i did not i mean i worked really hard and sort of gave hypertext fiction everything i everything i had and then i felt like we lost the war and then i moved on to other things but i think i think it the sensibility that went into it and sort of tapping aesthetic tactics stuck with me and are there in my later work so so i think i will stop there and then let you continue on and then you can come back to me then okay great thanks so much catherine for a little background there and that s a straight onto tv i m going to share my screen oh it s telling me how god i have to install this audio device we can hear you yeah but from my video let s see if this will happen i ll make it loud enough retrace your screen again can you see everything fine yep yeah yeah the sound turned up let s see if this will go find so i m going to show a video clip i can t show youwhat it s like on a performer without being in my lab and using all the livestream equipment so i m showing you the reversal that we did already all right i m going to show about two or three minutes of it that when i was the age when i read thisstuff i used to write really really a lot of poetry and then i would burn these are the ones that survived that experience i mean not not whatever the last time i read and the ones i thought were good or at least at the narrative children of the women have golden era is their delicate bodies sweetbreads in their mind their last demand us when he reaches out and touches his flesh the mind wears a mask or protection tells him of beauty i ll show youthat i am a child of the womb and i have golden bear in my body but only in my mind i am only another body was makeup mask perfection my golden eyes try not to do believethere is no way now i m trying to remember why is that one and that would not be accidental and that s that s not to the individual i m wondering i don t i don t know the answer tothe portal blade much sneakers now that s an alex because it s literally come through the woodspreceded by alexia that says first you can still if you re arguing but after a while you seem to gradually die away until all was dead silence andthe two girls listening to the bedroom door but you re only adult and now she s over the press so this one large pieces right they come in here and there so you you take snippets from colleagues and from other places and we are there is you know intentionally broken cars best for him and for enforcer them through the looking glass that s in here in broken into his word small large cases the title actually came fromthe same period of time maybe a little bit earlier home and the social somehow a mirror had gotten broken on the left on the kitchen table or my parents saying there is a mirror downstairs small and large okay so from this video clip of catherine during her reversal of her work we learned several interesting pieces of lore first as a child she wrote poetry and she burned it right to despite that habit some of it still ended up in her novel and and we got to see some of it three textural elements are purposely placed and designed in the novel they re not any accidents in this design for she sides to the looking glass and the enforcer and five the title came from an incident from her childhood which involved like thestory broken mirror right a broken mirror so this clip is one of seven from the reversal of in small and large pieces that astrid mario and i and catherine s did in my lab back march of this year and it is the th one that my lack is done since so that s quite a bit so what i want to talk about is you know what is your what is it reversal why is it important and what are we getting out of this expression this reader experience this this performance that we ve just seen all right so let me move this out of the way so i need to hear so the reversal is a process it s part of the pathfinders methodology for documenting works of born digital media it was developed by stuart multimap and me in support of with support from the national endowment for the humanities it s been used specificallyfor works like hypertext fiction novels poetry essays and more recently for flash works so anything that can t be accessible to the public anymore because of some sort of technological obsolescence and small large pieces for example this work was produced with storage space software as astrid mentioned earlier on published on two three and a half inch floppy disks one is for pc and mac i m going to show you the images of that again so you can see that and also on cd rom and it was published in the course that escaped quarterly review of hypertext volume one number three summer and so it s no longer accessible to the public unless you have a floppy disk reader of some sort on your computer you can use system seven and you can you know you can actually access that version of storage space or you emulate it and so what i m talking about is not emulation i m not talking about migration i m talking about using the originals hardware and software which is a form of collection right specifically a reversal is defined as a performance or reading that takes place on equipment configured as closely as possible to the system used to create the work order in which the word might have been expected to reach this initial audience it s a reflective encounter with the digital text and as you saw asteroid and and catherine were speaking together right answering each other responding to one another and that is possible so it s a way for us to get to the possibilities of the text and explore it in ways that indicate this key features capabilities and themes and in the case of this particular work we saw the different type faces right so key feature that work is the use of typefaces and if you don t load the font suitcase into the computer and you don t see that and it s a huge loss of the work so giving a performance on the original software allows you to see that right so along with the reversal pathfinders also includes images of the physical media the key thing with this kind of methodology is the physicality of the work and leaving it in its original format right accessing it its original form so we ve done for the pathfinders we do the reader reversals we do interviews with the reader the author reversal interview with the author we also do social media work most recently with the kind of innovation to the pathfinders methodology we doa lot of work with social media capturing the work for an audience beyond the lab beyond the place where the reversal is taking place we re doing youtube live streaming so that it can reach the audience at their homes or offices and then we re also creating digital korea critical essays and of course doing the images complete images of the physical work as you can see here from this chapter of rebooting electronic literature you know everything from every page to a descriptionof what people are seeing so all of this is very intently done it s all put together into a book that s an open source book on the scalar platform and made available for free accessible to the public all html css and javascript so it s a it s a way to retain the original cultural context of the work is close to possible by making these kinds of elements available documentation like pathfinders is one way of preserving works that are no longer accessible the puck to the public there are three types of of preservation projects collection is one migration is another and emulation is a third and in my lab we offer the third i have computers in my luck chronic literature lab and we were able to access the floppy disks andcd rom and whatever other technologies that are being used and read the work on the original format and do research about those works in that format goes beyond just the traditional thinking of the work is just digital and not having any kind of physicalpresence for those of us who cut our teeth on hypertext in the early s the physicality of it was a big part of it as esther was showing us earlier the little folio that that came with this looks like a book and it was done purposely this way so that people would understand that they re supposed to read this that it was something that can sit on the shelf so it is a transitional media from the print based book environment from the late th century to the current you know cloud computing works that we re getting now so that s why this is so important and it s important to capture this in a collection mode is we re doing in my lab so thank you for that and i ll start my presentation thank you so much jeannie what is it that you re doing with tinderbox for us just a sort of rendering or translation but within the same family of problems which is very very interesting and with with this piece that the segment that i have prepared we are we are moving towards the the main subject of the conference about platforms about and relations and and we have in case of stories present findable so quite an interesting case i hope although as we have had in small and large pieces might not be reachable on multiple computers outside of emulators the native format can be read on modern computer on another machine in tinderbox software and it can be read in a much better way down in storage space d which actually is is that is the official software should today by these days for for current audience but is not really able on its own to open and read install and large pieces before that you know the actually to be able to read st catherine s work on contemporary software and software bridge is needed something else dun dun tinderbox even in order to be connected to form that connection between past and present and iwill show you such rich here we see the in the bridge our case the breach is sponsored by storage space to on the us both in classics massive motorola processors and a newer maximum into processes on one side of the bridge represented the past is katherine s work and storage space the original on the other represents the current technological media is the oldest thing that pops up around on the current machine in my case it was in the box center it s a very interesting thing i discovered of platform distance the closer that distance the better before the wh so for example if i wanted to open it is to file into a box name this will be problematic and it causes crashes but if i open on my new laptop into the book seven and try to open this those things to file the bridge application it succeeds of course this sort of software one might ask is is a bit similar it s similar to a form of hacking orfire but because because a tinderbox is a direct descendant of storage space i would say that it is it is not really a hockey it s a proposition it s a proposal of another sort of reading more alike a big data textual analysis but of course in our case this big data is relative it s it s confined to the hyper doc space of the narrative network of the original so we not that detached from text and from meaning we are still quite close to what catherine has has written after opening the work in tinderbox we are presented with hypertext map something which catherine actually never intended for the original audience to see so this is this is breaking a breaking of that contract between reader publisher and writer but this is this is how it is today on tinderbox platform and here s an example of one of the most prominent like cs rendered in tinderbox all styling all phones and we could see in the video that dina has shown that phones were very very important for capturing vision here everything is is gone but what is preserved is the linking structure in the maps the karate key of contents the information about incoming and outgoing connections so instead of regular reading which is really not possible and reaches the intention or the original the original product we have this sort of hyper text analysis thatis close to those big big data analysis we are used to word count variations can be shown average word spell xer text links main links all this technical hypertext data in timber tinderbox nine sentiment variation is possible to be to be shown it s a new ai text one feature not yet fully implemented it comes from a demo of backstage release when we look at the word clouds we could see that words such as honor honor the room mirror door the most important and most frequent once used in the story and smart search and action queries that are able to generate rankings lists of of nodes that we can then rank according to our preferred attributes and then hybrid games the most important ones will be the inbound link account and outbound link accountto show us the most connected lexi is the notes with most outbound connections these on the right hand side of the fallen important entry points of katherine s dense narrative network those with the most inbound connections on the other hand surpass most prominent points of re entry which is which is which is very important when we when we read or take into consideration that multiple travel size of the work the network ranking of alexa is another area we re looking at it shows the sum of outbound and inbound accounts top of the list of this list is populated by lexus below into the collected points of anna miller this is a group of very prominent and and very exposed to read and these are the points written by honor such a secret mona lisa and they serve both as points of entry and re entry in such context lectures that do not belong to the poetry collection such as the art and anna or gene but it is what those that do not are not points themselves but are pieces of narrative but still high on the link ranking of those that i could i could i could call the center hubs of the of the narrative and interesting rendering of customers hypertext is hyperbolic view which is until the tinderbox addition to storage space mob view that shows alexia and focus in its newest and most relevant network neighborhood here we can see a model design focus and the lexus that are most close to it and that view comes on top of the top down structure of storage space for those and i thinkthese few few views of the of the classic storage space work bring some questions that might be it might be good points have to start the discussion on to add to the discussion i often ask myself are we able to see hypertext patterns through this tinderbox graphs maps and charts my best thing wrote about the figure of mirror worlds as as the one that is coming through standing out within the narrative of small and largepieces so the question is are we able to see the mirror worlds through these advanced modern hypertext analysis if not then the question arises why is it so is it because we still do not know where to look or perhaps the problem is is lying in our our approach to a problem which model actually lena called the continuity as an element of electronic feature of ethics if i could in essence poetry is often an arc of contiguous an art of distribution arrangement and the recurrence then a literature works and hyperlinks even more so than a methodology of finding at continuity points within hypertext structures places where structure with meaning would be a solution and rediscovering hypertext patents through the tools of thissmall big data of of hyper tech space and i will stop here thanks thanks my use was so fascinating and we were yeah we were talking about you know the chat you know people were talking about migration so on and you ve you ve obviously showing all migration can not just you know translate a work to anotherplatform where it can be read but but also analyze and analyze big data which is amazing this is this is really great so we ll we ll come back to this discussion later i will follow with my own contribution which which have given the title emulating hypertext a feminist post from a logical perspective and i have an extended version of this paper which is quite europe you read heavy and you know in the system uploaded on the conference website so iwill just try and pick up some of those points and i want to reflect a little bit on my own personal history with this work because it s part of the post phentermine logical approach that i m taking here i mean most recently i engaged with it quite a bit in the context of a project on the escape quarterly which i hope will come out later this year and to that effect i visited vimeo or leviticus and i read this work on the macintosh for my cdand and since i didn t and still don t have access to historical hardware in my own institution i ended up reading katherine s work in this kind of combination between historical access and emulation and oracle vm virtualbox six which you can see there in the background but it really looks like the real thing like and it actually sounds like a real thing and it s just basically windows xp that that you can do emulate and the work really reads like like the cd that wetalked about earlier as well so the license this is a fully licensed of you know software and it s it runs a beautiful iso image of windows xp and that access is the storage space files from an external optical drive the files have been copied onto the emulators hard drive whichi can access them and i can like you know switch between the the iso mask so image and other apps on my my screen at the same time and of course this particular constellation differs radically from the original one and affords a very distinct set of embodied and representational experiences that can address compliment from them fully replace the works original fundamental logicalconfiguration however as james newman has quite aptly pointed out in relation to video game preservation which is huge obviously he says we need to shift our attention to the contingencies of play and from game preservation to game play preservation right and so with but we can say let s move away from the work and more into you know aspects of text reality reading and interaction so in this paper i adopt a feminist post for them logical perspective centered around material engagement theory this theory originated in cognitive archeology and anthropology and foreground the material significance of extended embedded embodied andactive cognition also known as he cognition so extended means the basically is the relational idea that mines and things are continuous and into definable processes rather than isolated and independent entities embedded for grounds to situated spatially contingent nature of these processes and relationships embodied emphasizes the fact that the things we interact with become cognitive extensions of the human body and in active signifies that cognition is not the representation of a pre given world by a pre given mind but is the enactment of a world goes as far back as marina so what we learn know understand feel is a product of our interaction with things around us and that includes of course technologies of reading and play so against this backdrop i argue that in a post pandemic media or coastal framework we need to remove the stigma of inauthenticity from emulation and reframe it as an integral part of restorative productive and ultimately feminist scholarship set againstthe post phenomenal logical economy framework my own scholarly becoming and this is actually a thing this is this is a concept from post them and ology becoming which is never isolated it s never just cognitive it s always embedded embodied and active right so this was contingent upon a variety of access features it was contingent on the material embodied in accident of the the original work on the original platform it was a dependent on the extended distributed cognition again that s also you know part of this this idea of distributed cognition of others working in the fields i think of rebooting right so whole collection and it was to do with my own embodied history of engaging with the work for now almost years ago that was the first time i looked at it almost years ago can you believe that and also the ethnographic your research i did with catherine and many others many other stakeholders from the escape and euro and then of course my own iterative rereading and that that idea of rereading needs to move away from just come to you know decoding or something like that if he has to move into a more embodied field so just a quick word on emulation emulators are and i m quoting from connie and others a piece of hardware software that allows a user to execute software on a platform for which the software was not originally intended emulators have proliferated especiallyin hacker culture as so called new technology so this is from your console book was written a lot about cheating in games and so liberty technologies used to circumvent and counter the video game industry planned obsolescence right so this is this is a thing they just not not financially viable to you know to preserve video games from a from an industry point of view the legal situation so running emulators fully yet several international presidents of showing that noncommercial uses of emulators and especially in cases where legal software licenses were obtained in the first place come under fair use and indeed as good and grown and others have argued emulation maybe the most promising solution for the long term preservation of any distance of boring data so my own institutionally supported use a virtual box is legal the tool is free software and the gnu general public license right so and i ve also got my own copy of the of the work itself right which i was using so the emulated version of of kathleen s work is of course a remediation that that replaces the audio visual and happy parameters of the s macintosh with this weakness of a two day to d emulator and yet you know many things are preserved like thelink structure the color scheme and you know you can open the the map you cannot see through you can only see the actual you know alexia the color scheme right lag is minimized and even the ankle key function as be preserved so you can press control and you know you get the the that would be the tinker bell or the tinker bell replacement on on a windows machine so the you know the scholarly analytical and also the pedagogical practices are obvious we nation has a particular range of functions in this panels distributed maturity engaged approach feminist digital humanities center collaborative across horizontally structured practices that are driven by an ethic of care and mutual dependence thethis is from cathy barons and others they prioritize diversity and inclusion in their contributors and they promote equity of access in a way that was the colleges and productively embraces individual software and hardware constraints and this panels post pandemic practice of live demoing during synchronous meetings leads to a cumulative complimentary scholarship that triangulate the works reception and interaction across platforms that analytical methods as we ve seen like qualitativeand quantitative historical preservation all you have so many methods coming together and and it engages the author herself and this is a real boon for us right in this kind of reflective and corrective meta discourse the author herself can revisit her own work and really think about what was that supposed to be there or not and so on right and so our project may well be referred to as we didn t project you know remember jessica pressman mark marino and jimmy douglas s reading project so we are kind of reading project post the dynamic emulation and that s my final point also turnedout to be a key nor technology in our project during our rehearsals for christmas to brazil in march for example we experienced significant lag really i mean big deal it was it was very very significant on the on the labs macintosh classic and so having the emulator as a backup and a planning tool simplify the process and ease collaboration and mutual updating significantly so in short the use of emulation as law technology is a creative feminist response to the patriarchy cable claimto historical truth and authenticity it s not about personal empowerment but rather but empowerment of the entire community of all those who have often abandoned their work assuming instead of editors and publishers who lack the means to upgrade andpromote obsolescence material of scholars who can easily reconstruct the navigation and text of love and have new generations of readers and students will benefit from emulated access in public and private spaces so and that s it for me and i will stop sharing here and return the floor to catherine who may have some further thoughts for us here yeah i guess my first thought that is the question of why i didn t unlock the basement which is to say why you couldn t see the inside and i think they the answer to that is may surprise you because on the one hand i had an agenda for what the story means and you know and what you should get out of it and so on but on the other hand as somebody who is like designing the packaging and walking into stores and explaining to you know thetattered cover this is a book really not just because i say so but let me explain why this is a book um i have not just an agenda about what the story meant and you know my adolescent poetry and my inner life but also i had very specifically an agenda about what the future of the book should look like and i m from my perspective the future of thethe messy node links structure visualizations did not have a good niche in that yet and they were an argument against this an orderly transition from the one kind of the book to the other until until there was better graphic design are better ways oflooking at it so um i don t actually mind that all people prying it open and seeing what s inside and the tinderbox representation but you know seeing that waster pried open clarified for me you know that i had multi level multiple levels of intentions for for for this kind of thing now there was one question that was raised in one of the presentations about whether now that you went once you pride it open you look at it do you see the mirroring structure in the in the nodes and what the thing is it s it s no you don t and why is that um i guess my my quick answer is that it s because it s much more in the link structure than the node structure and the links go every which way through and some of the links are visible and some of them are not and some of that isteased out by the digital analysis but um the node structure had to do with okay there s the chapter level which has to do with expectations about the book and then the tables of contents within the chapters again expectations about the book so there s a lot more having to do with the argumentation about the future of the book to be seen there than the actual argumentation of the narrative in terms of that node structure now they re the um i was really interested to hear about the explanation of what a reversal is because what my sort of operating definition having encountered it having seen this thing on on the web from you know a year or so ago which was the professordoing reversal reading it himself was get to that thing we used to do when we read this when when i went out and did readings um i didn t have i didn t have the fine distinction so illuminating to know what you think you re doing when you call somethinga reversal because i had actually not known that before um in terms of the emulation issues in the conservation issues um i kind of don t have a dog in that fight as i say i was making an argument about a book about the book and i went in and i pushed hard on it and i lost on the digital book is much much tamer and less interesting than i think it should be in terms of you know when you bought by a digitalcopy of something something the thing i react most strongly to i m in i m going to mangle the pronunciation of your name but what how do you pronounce your name margaret s yes mario s okay see i am i just this past term became a graduate student in complex systems and data science at the university of vermont affiliated with the vermont complex system center and they have something called story labs so i m actuallybeing taught a lot of those techniques you use right now and i actually have been pushing back on the one gram and sentiment analysis and such they as my own practice and my sort of gut reaction to that is that actually the meaning is in the five to seven grand level not the one gram level and that there ought to be more axes and the way the fremont complex complex system center doesn t they have they do have the positive and negative axes but they also have someother ones and so i have just begun working on something i plan to work on in the fall using text fragments from my collage poetry which i will show you a sample of right here um this is focus can you see text here this is from books and on i have a lot of these and i did them very obsessively for a while and there i i am interested in what is the stickiness between the phrases and why why those that that links that phrase seems to work but it s very there i wish we had another hour to go over that stuff and go screen by screen because i m engaged with that not because it s my own work but because but from another context and i see what what those techniques are like and my reaction is to try to bend them and reform them so i actually have a project i m probably going to work on on involving an algorithmic art use work from phrases in the fall but i thought that was so that was especially interesting now i tried to open the tinderbox version and i couldn t get it open but would be very interested in playing some more with that so um i probably forgot something but that s my reaction that s awesome gimme gimme you re muted one of the things that mauritian are doing we re putting a book together about migration emulation and translation and for the past year we ve been working in the last past six months in the lab trying to get flash works you know move from flash into something else you know and so the more i ve been working with preservation at that kind of level the more i see this translation study so the whole thing to me is no preservation is translation if i come at it from that perspective and look at because i ve never been a real pro emulation fan ryan i ve always thought emulation is really you know looking at something on dust box for example gm lorries i m you know its name is penelope and dust box is not a fun experience for me as opposed to looking at it on the original format but that said coming at it from a translation studies perspective you know being able to read the word with a lot of things are lost some things are retained you know and the wonderful thing about that is retaining that work at some level but putting that along with the kind of work we re doing in the lab for showing the physical media that people say okay this is what the wordsaid in this kind of lexical environment but this is what it looked like in the original i think those two things together looking at in relation next to the collection work that we re doing in a lab is helpful so i think that speaks to your notion of the embodiment villas i think a wonderful example for that kind of thing we just finished working with richard hortons we just migrated that story space work into html css have a little bit of javascript model and it turned out quite beautiful it s definitely not the same thing but we were able to capture the classic interface of a computer screens and then you could toggle over to the contemporaries we re doing a lot of that kind of experimentation in our lab with it but at the heart of this is translation i think well i mean the other thing is you open up an opportunity like like you just like the project you just did for the work to have another life which is to say i didn t like stick with leaving it in storyspace and not put it on the web because i think i totally should be on a floppy disk and i worship floppy disks i left it there despite the fact that oh you know wouldn t it be better to have it accessible and not because at the time where the where i most wanted to make that transition it would have been horrendously labor intensive and it was not clear audience it would be i d have um so um you know we re not emulating because you know mark has copyright for a lot of these things and i like mark a lot so don t want to do anything that s going to keep him from the livelihood that said we got richard holton got his you know god has permission right gotta i gotta hop right back to do that so that s why we re not doing emulationof those works yeah i mean if i had access to that i would probably play with it soi you know become but you know we were really kind of luck there was not an easy path forward in terms of doing anything else other than what mark did in terms of form because of what what tools are available at that yeah um and that was one of the reasons why i didn t write more of them it s like yeah i just spent you know a year and a half writing something that was obsolete in a year am i gonna you know do am i going to stick my hand in that meat grinder again and the answer was no way and he just produced to work on immune so don t be new some years ago and that died so we took her work and transformed it into straight html we couldn t even steal the html from the music because it was so ugly it was just so pitifully ugly so you know mark mark made it available he made it he made a system available for communicating the work and conveying the work i can t imagine your work on hyper gate or hyper card storage space what was it was the space was this wasn t just anothergrand on hyper card it was a vision of the book yeah and it was you know and i was married to a book collector which is just saved the quarter and i used to have like a bunch of books of my own that were like archetypes of what the book looks like that i would then use in digital things you know to decide what it should look like so it was i was looking for the you know i continue a continuous thing with the book as such i just wanted to say one more thing about emulation as well that was a point i was trying to make emulation is one thing when it s made for a broad dissemination purpose from more scholarly practices where you were just really trying to represent something for yourself and or your students which comes underfair use so there are different uses of emulation that we really have to you know bring algiers isn t it s not always the same thing and the video game industry is of course most and maybe mark as well mostly concerned with with the distributionalaspects of it right but at this point i quite like to bring in the audience a little bit the chat has been busy and and it s great because again this is a form of lower you know and i remember being a chat archivist for virginia tech with the upcoming project and that s awesome and so yeah i mean it are there any questions from the audience at this point i mean one of the latest ones from i was dini asking about five nine follow up for a moment if i might with catherine the in small and large pieces is embodied in storage space mo springs we have vicki s instagram they re all embodied in hyper card what we were doing is the media more so message the message morphs the media so we were really writing to a specific media which of course died before anybody can read or writeit i wanted you to talk a little bit more about that i know you ve really looked at how the future of the book works but as you were writing you were really looking at what can this media do how can we say things yeah well i mean i after i left escape i spent a year trying to figure out a way to get i m working novelists who publish regularly in whose work i liked and i thought would work well in that kind of context and i had a vision of there being a artistic practice that went from the way people who already wrote novels worked into something that allowed them to elaborate more on you know a precursor of this might be seen as an inversion of ng publishing romwere all his research was in there hypertext truly linked into his book um one of the other things i envisioned was a science fiction where the math could still be in there because you have to strip the math out in order to write prose fiction but a lot of it you know it s very was very scientifically and mathematically basedin terms of where the cold equations um so i had a i had a you know i founded a company called black mark productions and i spent a year like writing business plans and trying to figure out how to make this work and i m how to get off of the island that escaped was on into the broadermarket and i figured well if somebody if somebody gave me a million dollars i could spend two years working hours a day losing all of their money and so i gave up and moved on um so there was a kind of transitional thing where i had like target authors i have in mind and techniques andthe but it could not work commercially given the distribution system um so yeah there was a bridge that needed to be crossed and when i say novelist i mean this is not to disparage hypertext fiction novelist but writing a hypertext novel in the sense that we his work was selling it s not the same thing as writing you know a piece you know page thing in chapters with consecutive narrative i felt that i had an editorial vision where i could have made i could have brought in that group a group of writers to do that it just was not commercially viable and that was that what you were after or you have a different angle of attack you were after i certainly could say other things yeah the commercially viable part of it was so vital and i know the time to we were just commiserating over this difficult difficulty was as you kind of alluded to everybody was like well okay i could spend times my time writing one piece notget paid for it because people expect and still expect people have things for free on the internet and it will die yeah i mean there were you know at that point you know i talked to a number of writers they had contracts for a pop they had writing schedules they had books to deliver and they had an audience that expected to you know to receive those and once somebody would have that you know was in that status and they wouldn t necessarily be earning shall we say a middle class living doing that but they were meant that they had something that was paying them to do their work and saying well why didn t you come join my circus and not get paid was just kind of not viable so then the question was can i find somebody foolish enough to give me the money to pay them anyway and then we ll lose all their money you know it s just like there wasno there was no bridge to the bill because of the of the contractual infrastructure and how writers got paid that i wanted to work with and i wonder if it s possibly different now years on years on exactly it is different now but there s also things have run off in all directions yeah different problems so you know now they ll make an ft or something right right and possibly what we could do and people were thinking about it was writing to an nf t so taking that in ft technology and explored exploiting that and exploiting that for for some kind of message again the creativity yeah well i ve been having conversations about nfc and with my my studio in toronto and have some ideas about thatbut the question is can you do it in a what now in this case well maybe it could be financially viable but ecologically viable and what any of our reputation survive if we did it if it s not so it s not such so much later okay yeah now i understandhow to get paid but no but everyone will hate me forever after yeah what is the carbon footprint of nft exactly i will be quiet now and let other people couldn t find out that things that s great yeah any other questions from the audience i mean just responded catherine i think a lot of people that were working in this field were academics they had had a day job you know and they could afford to experiment and to and to do this right but not it s hard i mean this is i mean writing in general is hard for anybody trying to make a living whether it s print or electronic me a lot ofmy friends that are print writers are academics teaching in a creative writing program i think one of the reasons why there was a spot by a certain point into my pushing on things and my prod projects or my my viewpoint about the future of work and how to get there was that um if i took what was being done which was getting people academicjobs and made it into something that science fiction writers did that was a threat to people getting academic jobs from it so there were people who may never mind the economics there were people who really really really didn t even want me to thinkso there were people who never mind the economics there were people who really really really didn t even want me to think because yes there was an academicwas an academic path toto success here that was completely separate and that actually paid a lot better than being a novelist getting a book i remember it neh summer seminar vk hills being you know with these other people at the seminar and somebody was talking about mark america because he makes he makes money and happiness and they were in this person was going on and on about how horrible this was and this show he really wasn t an artist and i hope this doesn t get out to anybody else but i was very offended by back some of what i like him he s one of my my dear friends but also we sit around talking about how we don t make money at this andhere s somebody who s doing it and gives us a model for it and now we don t like him for that so i you can t lose it you know you know mark america was one of my co conspirators and the um we have we have a lot of conversations and there was thissort of weird moment where you know the electronic book or whatever was coming and there were like these venture capital types lurking around and wanting to see what his business plan and that s that s part of what provoked me to spend a year writingbusiness plans that i convinced myself i would lose all of somebody s money but i would never mind this conversation we were meeting and i guess in the in the in the bar and the algonquin for some reason having to do is hypertext and lacks that hyper textual thing having to do with the movie and you know he said there s this guy who wants to talk to me about venture capital this is mark america speaking and he wants to fax me and he wants me to fax him and he wants to talk to me to fax in my business plan should i buy a fax machine here we are we re doing this arcane weird stuff and people want to talk venture capital and i have conversations like that and that s that s what provoked me to ok i will have a company i will write a business plan i will say that like we ve come upnow i m glad to hear that mark did better at that than i did but but yeah now we was a very strange time that we were doing these really arcane weird things and people got excited and started talking venture capital he was selling first editions i mean he was auditioning his digital work so i had a head and i was putting on a show physical show and a physical gallery and he let me show one of these works and he was selling it well that s that s right he had five copies and four of them and sold around the world so i had the fifth copy and so he s you know he s managed to do that marcus novak also did this this is this is the precursor as a precursor of nft and um i mean there s a lot of hot topic me a lot of a lot of negative things one can say that in a few years but you know in as much as one didn t get paid for the these are kimmy was like suddenly my all of my most obscure artist artistic impulses maybe have you know a place to go um and then the other thing i mean cycling back to what i was saying about doing with ubm i m also finding that there may be sort of big data applications to some of the kinds of thoughts i had about the fragmentation of text and how to understand it and so then part of part of my what i m doing with with ibm is trying to take to go from something like this to something algorithmic then can have to do with ai and expressive language i mean they might sort of working in concert of my working namethe my working name for that project is teaching the pig to sing you know can we get computers to really write computer write poetry can we get you know what can happen with that and so i m having conversations with a number of people with sort of technical platforms to understand how we get from those graphs that that we were being seen shown in the middle presentation to computer expressive language that that s good and meaningfuland resonant so justin has a question you want to get this question it s about culture specificity right and financial so the justin are you here you want to ask a question justin or you want us to read it for you come out oh sorry i had to unmute yeah i ll read the question um so my question is the the commercial viability problem that you ve brought up it seems to me that it feels like a western problem looking at the japanese software market in the s and even today were narrative game or game like text based experiences were i m continuing to be a really major market with a lot of money in it and a lot of innovation going on especially in the diabetes that we see effects of all over today so do you have any guesses what that might be about why was that something cultural that was different between the japanese market the markets you wereworking at as it s just that they had they stumbled on the marketing magic that we didn t find what s going on here do you have any ideas okay well first of all what the way you described the japanese market and the japanese game market is somethingi know zero about but the way you described it was going on simultaneously and in parallel and the us to i mean one of the problems we had was okay we ve got this experience we re offering here um but the competition is missed and but there were other all kinds of other things and there were narrative getting narrative narrative games that were out there i am not a computer gamer and that was not a thing i was interested in what i was interested in was the future of thebook now the future of the book um i was married to actually i wasn t we weren t married yet but i ultimately was married to david hartwell who s a science fiction editor i was sort of in the belly of the beast of the american science fiction field and the american science fictionmarket we did go to other countries and we did know people in other markets but that is very much an export market and so my view of how the book could transition from the thing the thing printed on pages to the thing i felt we were trying to invent was very much conditioned by the american market now it s possible that the japanese market was even more so than than what i saw around me in terms of the games and of things but i was not interested in games as such i was interested in books and what the future of literature would look like this is not true of everybody working and there s lots of other people were doing lots of other things but that s what i was up tobe interested to hear what particular types of text justin is talking about are you talking about like visual novels with ren p style which you know tend to have like like a mix of anime and quite a lot of text at seminars or are you talking about text i think the the those definitely i would say will qualify but even beyond especially the further back you go those genres were not codified the way that they are now they they looked something you know anywhere from text adventures are two sortof heavily so i would say almost adventure game like branching narrative structures to where they were as i said you know tried to experiment with the form in the same way as was noted it was a parallel development but they evolved into i think what you re saying visual novels modern adventure games dating simulators have a specific japanese style that remains a massive market there and has for years at this point whereas i think at least in my own experienceworking in commercial games those sorts of heavily taxed are primarily text based experiences are only just starting to reach the mainstream of gaming audiences i understand we re not what i said there s not an interest in games in the same way but it feels like the culture was more receptive right from the start to this sort of experimentation with digital i think i think i think it also has to do with our particular outlook i mean one of the things that s not that s not preserved because robert coover pulled the plug is the hypertext hotel new which was going on simultaneously and dina and i used to be up at three o clocko clock in the morning writing poetry at each at each other and essentially what that environment was what the move what move format was is it was in a text based game and we were very easily and energetically engage with trying to co opt the gameformat into literature and so and this i think has more to do with what i what being larson wanted to do rather than necessarily what the market wanted so there s what we did and then there s what the market did and there i m sure there are lots of other gamer people who could tell you informed things about that but it as much as i encountered games i tried to co op them into literature that was my program
