end of a terrific conference we re so excited about all the speakers we have for you today we ve got four great talks and they re going to give relatively short presentations i see a lot of at least three of them are linked to things where you could go and read them perhaps you ve already read them who knows and then we ll have ample timefor discussion under let the groups introduce themselves as they will when it comes to their turn will do all the presentations in sequence and then we ll have plenty of time for conversation so thank you all for joining us and don t forget that if we don t have enough time for conversation for whatever reason this panel goes til of course there s actually nothing after this so in theory we could just continue forever but at when we get around to my time actually has to my time idon t know what time it is wherever you are then you can always send the conversation into the track to discord which will remain at your service okay so without further ado i m going to turn things over to our first group we have as you said with this this panel is called this whole this whole panel is called pedagogy and methods and i of course and mark marino your moderator so so let s let s get started with our first presentation by rachel horse kendrick james esteban morale suutk that and fm young and they re tight their talk well i ll say their talk but it s called sounding the futures imaginary a collaborative intra modal storing method thank you very much mark thank you for that wonderful introduction hello and thank you all for joining us we are members of the digital literacy center dlc at the university of british columbia you re in vancouver canada not vancouver us in this session will briefly introduce you to is cocktails a collaborativenarrative that we created over the last months while we re all in the midst of a global pandemic as you know more specifically will share with you the methodology which we have created and indeed continue to develop this kong pails will know shewill now share with you this collaborative pathway where we have engaged with multi method multi modal digital techniques to create narratives each of us will now explain the step of this process process in which in which you can get involved by visitingour website which will share in a moment in the chat our first day duration of this collaborative storing methodology happened in september at the basement of kendricks house yes face to face in between time of provincial wide locked down when regulation was somewhat loosened with a hint of awkwardness we gathered surrounded by thousands of vinyl records we started our experimental collaborative future narrative writing in response to the following questions what will sound sound like in an increasingly digitized future how will meaning technology evolved together and apart how can we collaborate to believe right the future in a way that allows for multiple perspectives and properties as we were sitting up the context a skunk passed by by the window basement window and into our story to universe becoming the central cyborg can post human figure of our future future imaginings we wrote simultaneously allowing the thoughts to come freely we wrote for a set amount of time and then read what we had written allow to each other around the people in this way elements and ideas and characters began to circulate among us as we will discuss further the skunk deals there now write it throughthe feedback loop of writing reading aloud and certification of the breaking text fm is going to tell us about how we solidified the texts who just want to find the text to be bro we use singling an application that we developed in the digital literacy center we created this software to facilitate the learning and analysis of reading by listening the audio generated is based on the lexical grammatical properties of the text which forms a connection between vocabulary and grammar our second iteration of this collaborative story writing process took place in october at the auto inquiry researchgroup symposium continuing from where we left off at tedx house he composed the second chapter of scalpels life this time using single interest on the fact that texting real time we wrote me with the unified in singling for a certain amount of time then we copy and paste it will be there on to tablet where the stories can be read in a linear timer kendra good now tell us how we can be the parent differently and we ll take you now to the website which will put the link for in the chat and on this website we would be basically exploring a number of different multimodal ways that we could share the ideas and experiences of a nonlinear futures narrative and so when engages both with the soundscapes we ve created by using the narrative and just as an example of one of the different chapters that we created we ve taken the work of jim andrews and notable electronic literature artists his his programcalled stir fry and in the stir fried texts we ve gone in and taken the code and allowed the different sections of the text to be palin c est over each other so as you scroll over it you can encounter nonlinear presentation of this narrative and througha number of different experiments we ve tried to give the reader the same generative experience of encountering a nonlinear narrative structure and now we ll talk from rachel s perspective about how we can how you can in fact engage in this ongoingnarrative that we hope will continue until the pandemic is um yeah so through a oh it looks like rachel s frozen so maybe we ll just continue oh that s too bad so we ll just continue until she can join us again in this further stage of this cocktails narrative we ve created a thing that we ve used for a process we call the patch and so we ve taken all the words in the several chapters that have been generated over several different iterations of creating theskunk tales narrative and put them into a version of i read fast which allows you to adjust the speed of the words that you see and then if you go down you can just allow you can enter words that strike you because they resonate for you are you you catch them in your head as they went by great speed and write them down a little below it if you scroll down you you ll see thatyou can in fact then add to the pamphlet the format that we ve used for much of the creation of this narrative and generate your own bits of text which we will incorporate into the overall narrative structure we look forward to talking with you more about this project and its many different problems and extensions as we get into the discussion period so thanks we ll put links in the chat i think that was seven minutes was great that was great yep all right i love it all right rachel do you want to say a few things before you give a bonus moon if you want apologies that my this that s the one minute that that i lost connection of course when i m speaking so apologies yeah it s classic it s classic i thought that was part of the performance but actually i m i m so sorry that happened there but there will be plenty of time to catch anything you want to add during the chat for sure okay well next up we have elliot hedman who s going to be presenting improving readers participation and academic engagement with inquiry inquiry based reading in wonder stories thank you mark hi everyone i am dr elliot hadn t been really inspired by everyone s talks and the creepy things you guys all come up with with what could text look like i want to show you a small graph here this is your brains on books more specifically this is the third grade english language learner as he s reading the voyage of the dr doolittle i helped invent a sensor at the mit media lab where we measure emotions and this actually this little spikes there those are moments whenhe s getting engaged but seven minutes in he had to do little or not the best of friends in fact there s a big drop off plot of drool on first page when we came back and checked in with them now okay so one kid didn t like reading but it ends up being the case in this day and age of kids that don t want to read they don t enjoy reading they don t like it this is a problem because the number one predictor of a kid s success in reading is how much they enjoy it if you read a lot you re going to do really well at it but how do we create a world today when kids have all these ipads and all these games where they want to participate where they want to read that is my big question that i ve been trying to research so we did this kid who read dr doolittle in the same day we showed him wonder stories this is a digital reading tool it s an app you can download it i ll link it it s wonder stories that app when he read wonder story this is his skin conductance that that s every one of those spikes and to him leaning in participating engaging being excited about it my favorite part about his response afterwards was he told me that was a lot like math so re that it was almost a finance math for him that was a win but you know for most of these kids they re being told that they aren t good at reading that they don t that they re stupid or that they can t do it it comes down to is that they just notgiven experience with the right stimuli and if we have time i ll show you guys a video of a kid actually reading the the wonder story is but what i do is i do co creation at the boys and girls club here in denver where we work together with kids and figure out okay if you don t like a book what do you like what should it look like what should electronic book look like what are finding has happened and what creative wonder stories of even the reading itself might not engage in early reader questions and cognitive thinking is a really great way to engage kids when they actually have to participate and think about thingsyou think or if you re behind you don t want that but no you actually want an even more so in wonder story is because we saw these kids loving reading so much we created a bunch of stories that were solving problems so why are all the kids getting sick what what s rotten what food is rotten or the spaceship is broken and how do we fix itor one of my favorite questions the bus driver is a dinosaur is she going to eat me so these kind of questions the kids going to participate answer questions all are reading and cognitively thinking and doing a lot of comprehension with it by article goes into a lot of detail over the last year i actually ran the literacy program at the boys and girls club that stayed open during covert and even though i gave questions the kids were kind of engaged they were kind of there sometimes but a lot of times i mean i had kids first day toby reading sucks i don t want to do this and what ended up happening is i explored okay not only do we need to do questions but we need to do more to engage these kids who haven t read a book sometimes for almost a year and what ended up happening is that when we integrated wonder stories which occurred in a trivial like game where you can compete with others and get points this sense of social competition had an insane amount of engagement i started out with kids not even reading a book i like got one kid to read as soon as i put cahoot in with these questions i had kids telling their parents who were came to pick them up that they had to wait outside until they finished reading the book because they need to finish the game i also had kids asked me can we read another one i want to read another book and these are kids who are multiple grade levels below and hate reading and all we had to do is reframe reading into a more digital experience so i m kind of here kind of challengecan i see yellow more of an artistic direction but it s like actually digital reading of the future of reading for young kids i feel very alone in making this argument i m really excited to be there mark to be i think i think i ve talked to like only three minutes we have time to show the video you got you got three more minutes as a matter okay guys quick we gotta push the play button i want you to watch if i want you to watch this girl here because this is going to look very different than what a normal reader will look like like tell ussee whichdog when was the last time you saw a fist pump well i kids reading a book the problem is that most books are pages without ever feeling a successor achievement and kids especially those behind need those moments of the success and excitement and in myopinion digital reading is the future and that s what i m working on so thank you guys all right thank you very much that was excellent wow i m already seeing all the lines of flavor connection between all these talks it s almost like a perfectly put together panel alright so next up we have eleanor a sarah and natalie less cell andthey re going to be presenting and i apologize for not pronouncing their title correctly i ll say i ll call it lab or in an online laboratory for observing children s he lit and accompanying digital literacy so let me turn it over to them now i m trying to share my screen but they cannot think this up yeah now you should be able to so i m going to start while she sokay with that so we re both from quebec we re both teachers in universities in quebec we re french speaking you know no house so you tell you and we re in part of the last child of a shift in multimodal media literacy so good afternoon everyone thanks for being with us on this panel newspaper delayed our in the zoom fatigue it is a true pleasure for us to be here today and to share with you the lie behind website which is also a laboratory of researches which has just been launched for you and results from a long research project realize between and in the frameworkof concerted actions between phone society and culture research founding and the culture and communication ministry of quebec so in five minutes presentation or seven but i took one we would like to recall some elements presented in our text and maybe add some details the first element we want to stress is that we are presenting a work in progress we are still integrating content and adjusting design features and functionality so please do not hesitate to share your impressions reactions and improvement ideas the second element we want to stress concerns our team in fact even if today we can only you can only see the two of us a team of teen researchers and teen research assistant from different disciplinary fields education literature and art has beeninvolved into research in different phases of our times some of our colleagues gathered data among the publishers developers and independent artists some others interview teachers some others worked together with our co creation partners and some ofthem are still working on different projects right now with us certainly to that s lucky because my bill another group that we are working with so after these premises of few words about the history of this project the aim of the project was to support digital publishing any such initiatives for young readers and get back through an observational favorableproduction distribution and reception practices more particularly we wanted to insert three main research questions that you can see right now oriented on the one side to publishers developers and artists willing to go digital and on the other educators mainly teachers librarians and families willing to offer new artistic and legal or literary digital content content to young readers so it was a very big field to to look into so you can see our question research that are are the origin of the project and our objective so you can see this into text and right now in the the presentation so we had some different id identify documenting part co creating part and then we developed some content that we will present right away so data was gathered vs semi structured interview with different actors involving producing this routing or i can accompany the reception ofof children s digital literary works and we mainly identifying three major issues i m going really fast through the research part because i want to show you the the result so the first one offers the lack of knowledge about the curate editorial offer by educators librarians and more generally by coming readers the second issue is related to young readers specificities and pertains more particularly to school practicesinto cinco cognitive and affective process involving digital reading which largely goes beyond public publishers and creators experience expertise the third difficulty emerges and you can see all the ruptures points that we call that we could identify in the first phase in which after we could work through resolving both problem with through croak co creation so the third difficulty emerges with the slight difference between teachers librarians and literature mediators and offers in refers to likeof guiding material materials to find in present digital creation so i will let eleonora present to the library lead behind website and laboratory and over everybody so the library website has been created to reduce these issues and to support on one side publishers in developing new content and on the other educatorsand teachers in integrating them in their practice we develop need to the wordpress platform and we intended it as a virtual library on the contemporary children s the digital literature and art and it is aimed at providing conceptual informative anddo that research based on these them scientific data so it has three main sections one for education tool one for publishers and one concerning digital works its mission sire recording the first section of the of the website we wanted to add readers teachers and publishers discovering the different forms that digital rewards can have we wanted to offer publishers and educators clear recommendations to overcome their issues we wanted to present your research projects carried out with our partners and finally we wanted to inform the public of any news related to children s literature events publications prizes new works so maybe we can just see the main pages we have five sections the first offers detailed descriptions of the literary children s we have worked with the second is for publishers and present recommendations and advice based both on our research and on literature reviews the third contains descriptions of theoretical concepts on notions of digital literature that seem necessary going through introduce digital literature school and forth as some projects follow during the research and the fifth contains four sub sections and compiled relevant news on digital literature you re there is a call for action for a new research that we are fasting and that may interest a lot of you and you are already invited to participate and we have selected some works but to describe morning the day but maybe we can do it later because we are on our eight minutes presentation so maybe we can keep it for later and answer morning the day on these are works okay she can just put the in there then it s an english the the our new research you can you can find any english and it s on your first experiences and emotional experience of digital literature yeah we are trying to gather your first memories of ditch the literature oh sounds great adults are lovely answer those questions yes oh great very good awesome well all right very good well and i m excited to hear more about to these to explore the site and learn about the individual works because obviously i ve got a long term project of trying to collect those works interesting works of digitalelectronic literature for children yeah and now we re going to try to transition to our last speaker last but not least my collaborator and friend rob widow who is going to present net profit in the classroom character building and team building thank you mark what great presentations it s so exciting the pieces coming together like this so i am not going to hide the gold i m going to give you my two best tips for teaching net profit in the classroom this is a undergrad university classroom right off the top here they are the first one is called octopus hands it s an anti carpal tunnel exercise now i always ask if this is offensive to anybody s coach and i need you to do it we were just sitting there watching you need to do it you got to warm up writing after all is a physical activity so your fingertips come together and you move them through the water you feel how good that feels on the front and back of those poor wrists it s the it s the occupational hazard of all writersso that s tip number one tip number two if you have one chance to move when you re at your desk writing it starts like this you interlink your fingers like that straight up over your head oh my god we all need that don t you need i can see it you only and then you wanna go a little bit while go i ll go i ll go do it in the classroom head on stand up there you go excellent so scary when you see that okay yes okay um let s let s play starting right up so one of the keys to net prob internet improv is that the instructions are often less important than the model so what i need everybody to do is read these three models this is what i very often start out my students with read these three models and then write in the chat of this talk i need everybodyto write in the chat a similar post the three models you read the three models you ll get the idea okay so read the three models and then just jump right into chat no right or wrong answers it s not a contest nobody s going to grade you but just jump in and start writing that next thing so this series of models establishes what in theatre improv is oftencalled the game which is somebody will start a game that has to do with relationships and this is obviously a game of kind of mon cooler than you or whatever you d want to call that so go ahead i m going to continue because we re we re on the tight time schedule but just keep typing so everybody types at least one thing so just type of thing and it s interesting because um you know undergrad students love this this this cuts alittle bit closer to the bone for my early career and mid career academics these these three examples but they re they re good examples to start with and this is these are examples from a beautiful ancient website from years ago or so called tweetingtoo hard and that is the that s the game of that little writing exercise in a concept tweeting too hard so you re you re on twitter and you re tweeting to heart so everybody who s on social media can kind of recognize that kind of game so now i want you to do a following thing i want you to look at your own post and sort of imagine who might have written it because again i m asking you to kind of do this exaggerated bragging humble bragging is another name for what you are just doing so imagine that it s not you and that it s a character and give that character name and it can either be sort of a natural language human worlds name or i invite you to write a social media handle for who that would be so just pause a second who wouldhave who was the character who wrote that those words that just came through your fingers who is that so just write that down and now some of you i think are already can read the instructions and are jumping heads so once you ve established that name i want you to repost what you just did you can copy and paste it right out of the chat repost what you just did but start withthis name in whatever form it is and then a colon kind of like a script or you know a theatrical script or a movie script so start with the name if you want to like if it s a you know a natural language name then put it in caps you can anything in chat that i need to be know learn do you need to know about in this okay so everybody got their phone their rules okay is everybody reposting it so now using your character s name again you re going to start with your your character s name i want you to respond directly to some other characters post not the person spoke with the characters posts and use the the familiar social media form of addressi love the at sign so so be put your name colon and then the at sign so that we know who you re talking to and then i want you to respond to that person and what you re going to see is the minute you even start to think about that this character relationshiprelationship by your colleagues are you professional competitors is it a boss and employee situation where the power differential or the you know siblings or you know is it you know what is one person the narcissist and the other is feeding the otherone their narcissistic supplies one of my favorite psychological terms so just go ahead and respond pick someone doesn t matter just random and again nobody worry if somebody didn t respond to yours it s not a judgment we re all just it s all just free play and i m going to let you begin for the interest of time i m going to charge ahead and while you re completing that because i think we re all multitasker so what i find in teaching creative writing using them to teach creative writing is that i just throw students in the deep end just like i did with you all and that they love itthat the students will thrive in the deep end so what is an improv internet improv is one way of saying it i guess my current formula is networked and provides literature it s what people do it s when somebody s cats facebook account starts communicating with somebody else s cats facebook accountlike that snap prop it happens all the time it s not something that we invented something that people do but the thing that mark and i and others are are sent are asking now is how good can you get at it how you know how good an art form can this be and that s kind of a technical description of improv and it is not just a literary practice or an internet practice it s also has a lot to do with games what kind of a game is it it s not a competition scorekeeping game it s a game of memory can make believe so what i find after i throw students in the deep end is that they need sort of a contextual support because i make an outrageous assertion when i show them about net profit i say this is literature and it s like what so i say well what do you know aboutliterature like i m going to show you some things you know we all know about you know the the novel here s one of the earliest english novels life in a strange adventures robinson crusoe and you ll notice here on i always show this page this is theoriginal title page it s written by himself and we know it was written by daniel defoe it s considered a fictional novel but defoe died claiming that robinson crusoe was written by robinson crusoe it was not a fiction okay so i can i can start up here mark do i is that was that your timer sorry yeah that was my timer yeah okay so do you want should i just charge a headers that should i just wrap up there um well we can bring things out i think in discussion is my suspicion that we can get to some other points probably the best idea but or we can do or first question could be what s one more thing you wish you could have squeezed into your presentation that you d like to add now do we do we want to do it sounds like that might be a good route let s do that let s go let s let sdo that with everybody yes okay but it might have been a little tight okay sounds good show so let s give me i m not gonna time it best best behavior let s get one more thing you wish you had time to to say do we want to go in the same order reverse order this time rob you just got done presenting do you want to go first on that yeah i might i might just do that so okay so so rob s gonna say well let s do reverse order after rob so start with rob okay so the kinds of things i i show them for context are you know this moment where robinson crusoe is he insists that it s true and then only years later fielding has to insist that it s fake that he s not like these are notcoated satires of real people even though they have real sounding names samuel johnson is forbidden by british law to do accounts of the british parliament so he does have an imaginary place that he just invented and everybody knows that he s talking about what happened in parliament the day before a young middle schoolage kid thomas chatterton pretends to find a cache of beautiful medieval documents turns out that he had written them himself really forged time he wrote them they re all really authentic he s there s this is an archive he s shamed for that publicly commit suicide at age becomes a kind of a cult figure of the the romantic era awesome austrian of the imaginary scottish bard also mock but then of course tolkien does exactly the same thing essentially and then he s lionized later because that s because fiction is already up and established so anyway i just want to just teachpeople what that the origins of fiction look like this look like the inter the internet world now i give them contextual support from stage improv we haven t read the only po as also as context and do practices in the one i would like little exercisesand they build up to bigger projects the one thing that i would just say that i would love to recommend to everybody is in your own social media writing use the hashtag secret diary and then write something that nobody you know you would never share with anybody like something s your innermost thoughts and you just hashtag it secret diary and this it s a thing i ve seen it spread like wildfire amongstudents among groups of friends like this hashtag it s just it s a convention just like in theater we know that there are certain moments where this actor walks to the stage and talks directly to the audience and we all know that the other characterson stage can t hear them only the audience can hear that person so we re establishing those kinds of conventions in writing sorry i went on way too long sorry no problem okay next up so ellen her and natalie which one more thing you would you would like to add add on that one do you want to share the the end of the show one or two digitalliteracy i need you on mute yes maybe we can show are you on my screen yes we can show some works we have selected this one and these are an adaptation of a print picture book and it s the story of this little boy fighting with this monsters that represent cancer and it s not a sad story but it s very engaging and for each record we have described the team the construction team in detail the digital work and we had had did some research for teachers and educators if we add the we are that we added some elements of experience that we did with children this work is particular because it does our recreation platform inside so children can use never theological elements and rewrite their own story so quite interesting another one that we like to show if we like it because he realized by our member of our work research team in the framework of their research and phd research it s available in spanish and in french because the artist is spanish even if even if she s bodies in quebec and it s ournarrative of with several parts and there are six different endings according to the readers choices i was thinking the other day when there was them exhibition the keep keep the exhibition that diem issues the two observed in the possibility to access and discover works are even deeper for the french speaking countries because the production is mainly in english so it is really important to have resources in french to let publishers and teachers accept the content that s why the research and the website it s really a true need for our communities and we made the same choice you made for the exhibition sense that our website contains these are works more suitable for very young children and others then that can be used in secondary schools or year we are long january the the digital work iscertainly more difficult for young readers and we want to give it different so that each public me feel representing and i didn t know if you have a new we can we show every time we show where we can find we can find it because that s very hard in the apps it s it s so hard to just try with the title to get to find the the literature so maybe just to finish you know how show where they can they can do this for me it s the in this section the call to action you re going to share that in the chat too and i can also share that through yellow by the way i canmark we we wanted to ask you yeah no problem people would people will be very happy to fill that out okay so we share in the chat now great alright well thank you so much and then then elliot if you had one more thing that you could add what would you add oh you guys have told me what i should add so i will do what the chat have asked me okay very good so that question good so i m just going to share my screen so we have over books i mean this is all on my free time so it s not like i ve put them all up yet but and we ve had over of the boys and girls club this year and we just keep changing i m each time so you never asked him like what kind of books we started out with about minute novels all of them need to have cartoons in them and so we have ones about bubblegum getting stuck in the hair or a vampire that s trying to make kids laugh because laughter but then when i found out was that kids actually prefer much shorter stories becausethey really have about an attention span of about five minutes so he wants the most of us in the app store today but this one is about helping the headless horseman find his head and it s only a five minute story and we have a whole bunch of those theones that kids really like are the different ones about different cultures like why is there a turkey drying and an aztec temple and it ends up turkey for gods or why are people in spain jumping over babies and that s a form of baptism to get rid of devils those ones really resonate and the ones that are really resonating right now with kids are there versus story for its aunt vs stink bug and they grow them giant they go fight each other and we have to learn about different kinds of things about them i think the last one we had was like venus flytrap vs butterfly you learn all these things about the animals that they re fighting and you re like trying to guess who s going to win and how do you help them when the process so we ve really a collaborativeeffort to come up with those stories and that s where it s going very short stories and a question about every seconds the other question for me was how do i measure emotions let s see if i can pull that up real fast gg gg to here i am at mit measuring emotions this is my sensor and what we re measuring is your skin conductance and that s your that s how much you re sweating and why do we care unless you re sweating that s your fight or flight response no elliot it s not it s not cheering i think the screen a new share think it sure thank you i appreciate that okay there s a cool sensor well this we put these little sensors on your finger and they measure how open your sweat glands are and your sweat glands are tied to your sympathetic nervous system so when you get excited or anxious you ll see little micro changes in that thinking when your heart starts beating your eyes dilate you get those changes all the time so we re actually measuring that subconscious emotional reaction that s actually what drew me into books to begin with i ve done consulting and all sorts of different spaces but i just found that reading was really missing the children s reading was really missing those emotional engagements that a lot of othermedia they had was helping with so that s the tool i use okay that s fantastic oh my goodness i love all these projects too much all right next up this team skunk tail if you could add one more thing about your it s probably bad way to refer to you guys but if you could add one more thing your project and this can be rachel s moment to just say whatever she wants to okay yeah um i will just share my screen and just just make a connection with the story and the storing methodology back to our our pedagogy and our teaching so we ve used this tool this prompt and others like it to engage graduate students teacher education students with different practices of reading writing engagement so so this i think kendra to explain this tool taking the text and dd pulling out the linearity of it but still retaining some of the the generative qualities of the text and allowing readers and writers to engage with it and participate in that in that kind of narrative space so it s been a really this is part of other workshops that we ve done exploring this kind of create a deeply creative engagement with with text so yeah okay that s fantastic all right well let s go to i don t know what are we on speaker view or something like that do i have control over this let me i m gonna try switch to gallery view so i can kind of look at each other and then i m just going to go through the chat and just see if there are any other questions that we haven t picked up and then you guys can queue up for other ones by raising yourhand icon or typing other ones various comments la la la and there s some net profit happens a chef boyardee isn t here so i don t think your question okay here s here s a question from sarah you have a question sir she want to ask your question livein three which one are you have two questions in here as i have a question maybe do a broad question for everyone and maybe especially for natalie and noah how to educate in digital literacy so data literature you have got to get two minutes so can he repeat one more time for me sir so i get the gist of it sorry sorry so my question is how to educate in this digital literacy through jitter literature and especially through kid it and then i wrote can can we push to let that teaching the delicate matter maximally activates the operations involved in any detail reading okay now to take it isn t it s a project that we have and should take few years we just wrote a project about that and you want us to answer that now well we postulated that yes because we we think that kids should explore more and more forms of digital stories so they can be exposed to different narratives that non linear nonlinear leverage narrative so they can represent that narratives can benonlinear in many ways so i think the first project is a good a very good example so i think it s a it s not we don t we don t think in a explicit strategic way of teachingmultimodal p for example components and then and exploring it in doing it systematically we just want to go be able to explore many different digital stories on different digital devices and being exposed we postulate that you can anticipate the movementsand the interactions and the navigation and the possibilities of the different narratives that you are you encounter so maybe it is not i can say more but i think it represents what what we think right now maybe with a more applied research with someday does proving it we can we can show other ways and maybe alien i can complete but after i have since i answered i can ask a question so maybe we can go like that mark like kids do we can but before we do that let me honor i should all the questions in the chat okay okay sorry there s a second question from from dina dina do you want to ask your question life i don t know i don t hear it either so i will read her question so dina asked the question how do you teach the rhetoric of he lit how links work how images and text synchronized for meaning etc so i guess this this seems in some ways like an extension of surges question but it s going even further eight maybe i can start answering it depends on the public when we we we work in the education field so we work with future teachers when we work with featured teachers at primary school it s quite easy in a certain way because we have the print book examples and we start building meaning with interaction between text and images and then we complex defy we show examples of digital work and we try to build together with students the plastics the static and the rhetorical effects of digital works and we tried to do the same thing with secondary school teachers we use also known leader you work addict sunglass i m now working on media on newspapers so we tried to to show true examples what are the possibilities that makes a lot of sense and thank you i m sorry for my technical difficulties i was really fascinated by the wonder stories and the point with digital literature is that we can do the connections we which is much more than we can do in print and i was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the advantages of the electronicliterature the idea that we can make connections like cause effect next after and really start teaching these types of thinking skills and that would help so much you know you re speaking to my heart thank you i want to start with an interesting story on that that kind of answer your question and i ll answer your question but um so when i originally incorporated wonder story there is a there s choose your own adventure from there so you can okay how are we going to sneak past mom and dad there s one where you had to figure out where mom went and you actually investigated the car and you chose what to look at around the car when youdid that interestingly enough when i i m a i m a design researcher so i go in i watch kids redo things i put i tracking glasses on them i watch what happens and this choose your own adventures didn t work very well kids were treating them like problems like things to be solved instead of things to explore so they always thought there was a correct answer they re like oh i know the right way is i m going to do it this way i m like the relevant but you the kidsreally like this like almost black and white world of like i want to get this thing right i want to prove to you i m smart and you know that s what i capitalize on most of my app is all about meeting those kids where they re at so i m you know still an open space explorer choose your own adventure still is open but it didn t create what i was looking for like the sense of wanting to see everything and that explosion was much more about them getting to cognitive problemsolving so that leads to your bigger question is like what is the so i just gave a talk where they re like what s the difference between digital and physical and like everything will be digital in the future and it comes down to comprehension abilitiesand you were talking about that with that cuddle thing um i actually have a real real problem because i m not i don t have a writing background you guys are all so much smarter than i am i m just a humble researcher but what i what i discovered here was that writers don t write for inference so like i would ask writers to write for one or two reason and say johnny came into the house with a red coat question one what color was the coat i m like no no no one wants to answer that question and so i had to go back and i m like no you gotta say johnny comes in he s wearing to keep it a math what costume is just like who does johnny think he is he s a superhero that inference is actually a really high level of comprehension and kids aregood at it like they think that kids can only do it at their grade no i have kindergartners doing it all day long it s just they re never challenged with it they never given these opportunities to apply influencers now here really awesome parent youyou can actually create moments of influence you can talk to them like what do you think s going to happen next what do you think s going to happen it can happen but writers don t do that we almost always just tell people things and so i feel like whenever i hire writers it s like all right get ready for a whole spiel of things that i ve barely understand myself but i m going to ask you to do things differently so there s a lot of opportunity there where we put the reader in the driver s seat and even a mystery novel never puts the driver in the driver s seat because as soon as the person figures out the mystery is boring you only figure it out on the lastpage so there s a whole new art fair about this space that makes a lot of sense and yet with with the folks that are just saying question answer question answer and you got the complexity one of the things that i think mark and rob do this as well you can do a writers workshop where you get just pieces of paper different ribbons yarn whatever and show the different types of connections you can show how things work and i think you re doing such a wonderful job of teaching the kids to think let s think these things through damn it yeah and hypertext any electronic literature can do that so absolutely thank you absolutely could reiterate that s what the kids want to what you guys are out everyone wants it it s just not how i agree now now i m gonna pull a question from andrew because he s asking question later on the chat first cocktails we haven t heard i haven t heard from those guys in a while andrew do you want to say yourquestion just cocktails cocktails uh well i think oh it s for the other people what they think of skunk tails that s right that s right so i just i wanted to get the we have two different really interesting methodology here can can they may be talking about each other sokay what do they think of each other s projects okay fair enough good have that what do you all think of each other s or wait what maybe a better way to frame that that might be more productive for everybody go around the table what are you taking away like where do you see either lines of connection or something you re taking awayfrom another panelist project how about that one who wants to go first just jump in well i was just typing some thoughts around i love your work elliot and i m thinking about my son and and and his difficulties with reading and how he liked that s the problem solving and that kind of immediate sort of what is it in getting the answer and that kind of engagement but i also worry or wonder abouttotal digital the total digital thing and some of the work that we ve been doing in the digital literacy center is around making the analog and the digital experiences so that they can move together and not forgetting the embodied and that tactile andpaper but also the digital and so i wonder if you can have if you have thoughts about that well i m really excited about your thoughts on that rachel spoiler yellow i m on the last part of a grant for a full year i m looking at what you just said which is what happens when we take wonder stories and put it into a physical world so what happens if we build a clay model while we re reading or just things we re like interacting and cognitively thinking about the story while we re doing it but i m curious for you i am very i have no idea what i m doing don t tell that to the group people rachel what do you think about that multimedia perspective i love the idea of sculpting and that while while i m while engaging with the text we ve done things like you know we taking a picture and uploading it or you know something from your environmentor going somewhere or you know having to read a you know underneath a doorway or something like some ways of i don t i don t know but like i think that that could bring it out of the total cerebral just you know touching touching touching buttons i m sure people have lots of thoughts on this all right now what else are you learning from each other s projects are your takeaways i i ll go next since i ve really appreciated lambregts thing cuz here i am with my little digital tool and i m like oh man i didn t realize that there s this whole marketing thing i have to do and just this idea that i m not alone it s just so nice it s like oh you mean that there s like a lot of people out there who are trying to make a difference and i and there s people out there trying to like solve some of these really big challenges is that at the end of the day peoplearen t really seeing books as digital medium so how do you communicate that and it s kind of cool to see that there s a cultural front and come back all these cool stuff around education i m always impressed but i really i really appreciate during thatthere s a resource and people who are trying to do something on that space so that s that s very empowering on my end nice who wants to go next where i ll be able to go next yeah i just i absolutely love the skunk tales project and many things about it but and one of them was i love the kind of origin story of how you know it starts with writing in person and that which is just this incredibly fun thing to do and that based on that then this transition to zoom and and you know far away collaboration distance collaboration kind of works and because that s you know it s sort of my own story of hanging out with invisible seattle writing on one of the very early bolton boards and then moving having to move away missing my friends andusing the bolton board given the high cost of of long distance phones at that time like using the bulletin board to stay in touch with my friends and keep doing these writing experiments that we had started and then i just totally love this idea of having another kind of sensory neural circuit system the sounds as this thing to bounce the story off as a companion and and you know antagonist and collaborator and so on having that sound as the theme thatgoes all the way through i just think that s super smart it s got me thinking about ways of doing kind of dual track projects that are writing and then wind around other other media so i think there s just lots to be inspired by there nice nice it s gone chaos what do you got i just want to say that in some of those processes rachel was describing i ll give a little shout out to andrew that we ve been incorporating the language workbench gdpr language workbench which he and dave air built in almost all of it it s really central part in fact it s a very central part of our pedagogy and what he opens up is this ability of a text to morph according to you know parameters you set and i see so many connections with these other works you know elliot you reusing these wonderful bits of technology to read you know galvanic skin response and what have you and it just opens up because you know i ve done some experiments with galvanic skin response running midi so that it s converted into midi code and ofcourse that s how signaling works to it takes text and turns it into many code and so there s these ways that you know i could see combining where a student starts to get bored and he s on that downward curve after the end spike there in the attention he s on the downward curve and i m thinking you know like it just hits a threshold that triggers a question or it changes the narrative it reverses you know andrew when you know what can we do here we could change the adjectives and make it darkand scary instead of you know positive light and happy you know because some kids like that better so i just liked the idea that texts are in fact generative the reader is not reading something set in stone and digital literature makes that so much more possible you know you re talking about adventure stories and how you re choosing and is there a right answer and somehow the generativity that is possible especially when we enter some of these happy even analog interactive processes that they could just youlive in for for the board kid or whatever yeah i really like the idea of reactive like i ve never heard of that before it s not just like follow a path we re going to going to respond to where you re at well not just you just choose your path and that s really interesting i ve seen it in media they re they re really crazy style but i ve never thought about that like that push nice yeah and you yeah has a hand up yeah thank you and just kind of related but i m i m thinking a lot about what you said earlier that putting readers on the driver s seat and this kind of making inferences from what you re reading and sorry i m kind of i m taking a driver s seat and what you re saying but i study conspiracy theories and i was just thinking you know those who are really good at inferring making inference from what they re reading are conspiracy theorists excellent par excellence of making inferences so i was wondering you know this kind of i think i mean i know the author s dead but isn t it kind of dis making i wonder about the importance of not taking the driver s seat but listening to what the author is saying and be patient about it so i wonder if this kind of if your project can facilitate that kind of patients as well that you know paying attention to the intentionality of the author i i it s i did commander i m saying it with the coach on you know intentionality and so on but i was wondering about it i really liked her question also what kind of conference where can we have a conversation about that i just want to give a shout out for like wow ok i ve never thought about the consequences of conspiracy theories i wonder stories before question and i ll bring that up so i wrote a story about a fish and the fish escape the aquarium and ended up it was in the bathtub and it was wearing a costume the the girl stole the fish and put a costume on and put in the bath tub and the kids were pissed off at that because i asked the question i was like why was a kid the fish in the bathroom and it was like she wear a costume and the kids like fishes can t wear costumes like they were all just like letting me know that thatquestion was incorrect and that we did the we did the story wrong and i thought this was really interesting because you know no you read it wrong it wasn t that the fish can do costumes you didn t get the right thing but kids it was so disappointinglike if i kept doing that with them i would not be meeting them where they re at so it s a lot of me meeting them where they re at and helping them there because remember my only goal i like to try cycles of reading is like where the training waslike make sure that they feel like they re smart and they got it going and that gets to the next question you which is there are other things i wonder series of not teachings are the number one thing is just being able to read for a long period oftime i think another one is to discover ideas that you disagree with and to be able to be okay with that i think that s what you re talking about i think there s some really and i work with high schoolers in a while where they need to work on the thingsthings too i think there s a lot of skills that we don t really think about the wonder stories just kind of bad sad because i need to meet the kids where they re at and i am worried about that in part that i think i wouldn t want wonder should replaceall the teacher i just want to i want to get it from kids can read things and not say oh this is going to take forever i give up and that s where i m atright very good jeremy do we get to the question you were gonna ask all right go ahead why don t you pose it then you re muted i hope it makes sense at all i came in super late i apologize my friends were presenting at siggraph and i almost think they should jump into the elo my friend pat but donny has made a book and it s in it s a cookbook and it looks really s but it sabout food and raw and decay and it s actually a feminist commentary i think she said pop on over and then my friend joe davis at mit is looking at it s like ancient arabic art iconography in in the dna and biology and i heard mit mentioned i saw the sensor thing and my ears kind of popped up and i came in late so i don t know if i m coming out of left field but i used to be an editor for leah now i m a reviewer for leonardo and i would love to hear more about the connective area between research and haptics and senses and biofeedback notthe next seven days but like body reactivity and narrow technology i know it s been kind of talked about but that s fascinating to me i m happy to chat with you more i also the yellow article goes into it and great details and then also here s a link that will describe it more i don t want to repeat myself but yeah i could talk literally all day okay um rob has a question i just i have just a little footnote to that that haptics because i also was really loving that the kind of haptics body the you know sensory thing dimensions of these projects but just want to recommend to people if you don t know what there sa wonderful little george parakh it s called a sketch for an essay and it s and he s he basically says there should be a proper study of reading as a physical activity for example what s the difference between reading on your stomach and reading on your back reading on your sidereading sitting down and he s you know he knows it s it s these are funny ideas but he s being really serious and the the part of that that i love that i think just really that that i would love to see that kind of study that jeremy was pointingtowards and you folks doing he says a cafe i used to go to i used to see a famous philosopher he would always come along and he would bring a book and he would read while he was eating and correct says you know i would observe him a bite a concepta bite a concept what is the result of this double nourishment it s like and that s a super important question and i just don t think i think there s a serious area of research that that points towards that i d love to see people follow up on i love it i love it what a great quote my goodness is awesome let me save that for a while and while i m saving it i m going to turn things over to maria mensa who s had a hand up for a while too sorry now i was trying to discuss what what elliot was talking about before as well with the fish i want to go back to the fish back to the fish in the costume okay i m sorry guys nice because and well i haven t been teaching nearly two children but i used to teach art and i was amazing because already depending of the ages i mean once i think once they are over six they already have this kind of you know there they have these convention already have what things are you know if you re actually dealing with children that are before six year olds or something they re still going to be like really free they don t have any conventions yet or anything but i just wanted to mention because i was i asked they wants to do a drawing of their fellow you know they our friends our face you re not doing of theirand and you know they have some of them were incapable and i said but you can t see their face yes you have to touch it so practically they have to touch the face of the person and draw you know these portrayed they were like these you know like trying to see a little bit and trying to actually do a portrayed in the way that unfortunately supposed to be instead of doing a portrait that was based on the feeling of that phase you know and create something different and so i was just wondering you know in terms of teaching also a lead you know those kind of conventions you know that children already learned you know when the beginning i don t know if anybody wants to comment on that maybe i do knowis true for me it s one of the most wonderful thing when we work with children to see how they are surprised and i ll they try to manipulate the screen and the narrative for it for me the most rewarding moment of my research life and i was thinking always to answer to dinner of course we tried to work on interpretation gesture especially with mobile apps and mobile apps are strongly integrate to integrate into the narrative and children have to interpret their gestures themeaning of the gestures to understand the story so he tried to work in all this sense i m really interested in adding manipulate and are they your hands translate their interpretation so we are trying to build all all this knowledge we don t do it with eye trackers so i just tried to gather their statements and to study all they understand and interpret the narratives and their gestures and when they tried to recall it and to see what they did it what that what they have seen why they are surprised why it snon linear what possibilities they should have had in another context something is occurring to me here and really like i m just loving this panel and it s it s i m doing everything i can not to like interrupt this discussion with a million thoughts but i do want to share something i ve noticed across all the panelists that the word that keeps coming up across all four presentations is engagement and what s fascinating to me is that i think there is a mythological presumption that the experience of reading is abstracted from bodies and that it happens in the mindover a sustained period of time this is a deep attention the k nails writes about right and it has someone sitting physically still and we don t even care about what s happening to their body because it s only happening between their eyes and the textand no reaction no processing whatever it s just there they re letting the text do what it s going to do inevitably and what i love about all of these works whether we re talking about reading or we re talking about writing or we re talking about textsthat turns into speech or speech or text that turns into motion or motion that turns back into play in the play turns back into text right is that i think that you know in some ways maybe even this whole yellow conference should be called the multisensory symbolic encounter conference right because there s something that we deeply understand and we and teachers know it third for kindergarten teachers know it they don t hit they don t hand a child of book say here just sit in that little corner they read it out loud and they draw and they point fingers at the you know like all of those things right insane when we re telling stories to children right you don t sit there and say hey children sit there on the rug and i m going to tell you a story for four hours right they interrupt you and they squirm and they move their bodies or i don t know just all of this is really just got me thinking inin in so many different ways and again it s that you all seem to have some sense that there is this heightened level of engagement that we can bring to these creative or you know creative writing creative writing processes and that we ve got a wecan tap into that somehow maybe with the interface on some level or with some really well some creatively used instructions in the case of of rob and skunk tales i think perhaps anyway somebody want to jump in on that one and i know we re at time we re just like we re at the very end i really resonates with me and from really what i believe in i m careful with the word engagement because it means many things but it s about participation and attention for me but just to give you an example adults have this problem to one of my firstprojects was working on classical music you know what most adults really get bored listening to classical music send them to a concert if they ve never been before this is what it looks like going to a classical concert this is an expert going to a classical concert and it just ends up being the case that everything we do when it s novel and it s hard we need extra help to pay attention and to stay focused andbe stimulated and we think that kids are bad or they re troublemakers for wanting and i know that s actually the nature of human emotions and so we can make literature to meet people where they re at and we ve never had the opportunity to since nowdo that and it s fighting norms and it s being creative and trying new things that s really exciting i love it and again i love that that rob brings that insight back to the zoom experience with the students because we ve done we ve done it again haven t we rob we ve done that we ve just done it with a new medium well of course people like to sit in front of cameras for prolonged periods of times right why of course sure they do yeah all right well we re kind of time any last comments well just the last comments and i really enjoy working with kids on trends fiction and trends smaller trends smaller modality and i could see that they would engage and interpret without having been questions that would just do they they could transformtransform them the and while they re transformed they would engage in the origin of the end throughout the process and i think that can tell i wanted to say before that i really admired that the whole process creation collaborative great which is a really good example of the body in the machine in a postmodern conception of creation but i still have what i really wanted to say i still have a problem of representing the output i felt really bad i had no idea how it sounds or how we can see it so it s good in a way because it s the process throughout the process we can experiment all that we ve talked about and then there s this mystery at the end of how we can output so different ways with the technology so i i think i have to look into the examples that i don t know if there s word sounds of the words come into soundsup and and i have no representation and what i don t want to speak too much but that s the one thing that everybody that we talked to in the last year s told us is what is this digital story so there s a what s the answer it s a big question like sasha asked about how do we teach it well how do we start teaching or talking about it if we have no representation of it so that s that s our objective i think everybody here is how do we engage into the writing processes and how do we multiply the representation that we can make a digital stories that s awesome anybody anybody from the other groups when i give us some final thoughts i just want to say thank you guys it s been really a privilege for me because i m not i don t come from any live background at all and it s really cool thing people who are on the same page like most of my work is like talking to people like you know maybe we don t have to do hardbooks maybe there s an option and everyone disagrees with me and i feel very alone and here i m like holy cow you guys are more radical than me i love it like you personally and all sorts of directions so it s really nice inspired by people so thank you for being part of this so thank you for being part of this thank you thank you my goodness maybe we re on the same screen elliot well sad to say nicely done i feel like that s kind of a mic drop moment alright guys well i hate to really do hate to wrap up this panel because i have thoroughly as someone who writes interactive stories with his children and has been thinking about this for a long time and has been trying to get people engaged creatively with one of these oddball characters here and just delights in the synesthesia of the whole skunk tails project oh my goodness i just adore it and who from time to time dips into andrew clover cars workbench and comes up with crazy projects with deanlarson as well everybody here you guys just want to give you guys a great big hug thank you all for this final panel it is it s got my heart singing and speaking of singing up i it s very possible i will head down to the cafe let s do some dancing some finger dancing and
