the intro like we talked about and then just mentioned that andrew got sick from the pokey whoa whoa whoa whoa maybe use that phrase sorry i only use different praise allah she i was talking about the vaccine down i will yeah i will not phrase it that oh wow i ve never seen this before it asked me to either continue or leave meeting hi everybody um things for showing up to our panel community story storytelling beyond the table and onto the digital green this is really really early morning for me so if i trip up on my words my apologies hi mark i do see you in chat and it does feel like friday okay so i m going to introduce the panel first and then i m going to introduce our participants and then i m going to awkwardly present first just because order of topics that s what made sense so tabletop role playing games or tt rpg these are games of communal storytelling these game worlds exist in the minds of players who collectively populate them with people events and histories traditionally played in person groups found themselveshard hit when social distancing roles came into effect while someone on hiatus others took to the web to continue their sagas for some this was an uphill battle of new tech and social norms well for others the move was trivial as tc rpg is in fact have existed online even before the pandemic for this panel we take for granted that playing teacher rpg is is an act of oral literary production we talk about the ways the storytelling once done cooperatively but semi privately has grown beyond the table through various internet platforms toinclude a much larger production base we will also cover the ways platforms have enhanced the building aspects of tarp geez the building of communities world and narratives our panelists in order will be as follows i am dr kristen leave alone and we often hide learning process not wanting anyone to see our vulnerability and attempted normalizing learning and imperfection i decided to live stream my process of learning to be a dungeon master or dm on twitch tv slash gamer and throw additionally i hope that by live streaming this i would be able to tap into the shared knowledge and experience of my audience although i ve been a player for about years i ve never before been a dm i began live streaming my preparation in january with many questions casey james kelley wow i hope i said that right i m really sorry i didn t ask earlier was live streaming as a dm on twitter tv series play before the pandemic at that time the players use a campus lab to play in stream when the pandemic shut down campus the group was forced to negotiate not only how to continue the game but also how to continue sharing the lab channel previously all streaming was done at the lab which was set up specifically for this purpose suddenly the group had to set up across multiple computers and locations casey will be discussing these negotiations and the struggles of dm in virtually while streaming sorry i just momentarily got very distracted by chat edward fiber jackson is the personality behind twitch tv poke your eyes out games and founder of the gcgg good community good game stream team noticing the hard time somewhere having with the current state of the world and guided by the truth that weare the stories we tell ourselves edward decided to change those stories through tt rpg stream by having the players play both characters and themselves he hopes to slowly get the players to start changing the stories they tell about themselves and therefore change how they feel he will be talking about how these stories progressed so we were supposed to have a fourth participant if anyone was looking at the schedule they would have noticed that there was also an accuracy fudge unfortunately he went to get he got the vaccine yesterday and had a very bad reaction to it so i sorry but vaccinations very important so we re we re not we re not mad at him for that yes i can t go into presentation mode just detoxing chat real quick because if it does it actually covers both monitors and i have not figured out how to do that mark says i can share across streams i willbriefly try it out if it s really bugging people otherwise it doesn t actually above me i mknow and also doesn t make it any better oh i see oh i see it it s a yep off kilter a little there we go what about magic thanks mark okay i m also sorry for the cat tail that just put in front of my face she has left me alone all morning and now decides she wants attention okay so for my person i m going to real quick start with a an explanation of the game system and the universe just to give you context of what i was doing online so the system i m using is called monster movie it gets published by evil hat and it is a powered by the apocalypse game you don t need to know and all of that means just know that powered by apocalypse is a rules light system and then that has been taken and put into many different genres to be used for tabletop games in the universe that i have chose to use is the supernaturaltv so for those of you who are not familiar this follows two brothers sam and dean winchester who investigate the paranormal and hunt demons monsters and other things that go bump in the night the series is dark but it s prime tv dark not like hbo dark and i do not have the players engaged with the direct storyline but they are in the world so in that timeline at a certain point lots of spoilers for anyone who is behind there s a point at which for example sam opens the gates to hell and so when we get to that point demons will become more common for my players monster of the week is literally designed for this type of campaign i m going to read directly from their website a small clip and it says monster of the week is a standalone action horror rpg for threeto five people high school hunt high school beasties alo buffy the vampire slayer traveled the country to bring down unnatural creatures like the wind trust her brothers and supernatural or head of the government investigation like mulder and scully so i did not have to do a lot of work to make this system work with this universe now um so that s that s the world i m in enough for streaming i am not streaming the game itself this was something that i thought long and hard about but half of the players in my game our game scholars and we collectively decided we needed something even if it was just one thing that could be fully play and leader for and not be connected witha work and streaming for me as very connected with work however i did decide to stream game prep and why did i do that thank you mark i m chris lee just a quick question are you changing the slides right now because it s still showing the first slide i forgot okay yeah so i m not that there s a lot of information just give you a visual this is the cover art for monster of the week and for those of you who don t know supernatural these are all clips from sutured supernatural i will admit i am such a fan girl i already had all these pictures on my computer i did not need to prep that for this presentation okay so actually now why do i stream prep and not the game thank you casey um so the first reason i m going to be super honest because i am talking about me and moving it up all over the internet is that i know me and if i don t have scheduled time to do my prep then i won t prep i also know that if i m not obliged to other people i will not do that prep for myself by streaming the prep having a set time with audience members who are waiting for me to come i do the prep every week because they expect me to hear the other reason is because i have never been to before and being in the middle of the pandemic it s not like i could go into my local game shop or any of the other places where i have previously connected with the game community and this has actually worked out but nominallymy audience is half personal friends to be honest my gamer buddies and half of them are fans of monster of the week i m now interestingly to me just to make a mention real quick of how i got audience so i did these pushes over social media and what you re looking at right now are three different pushes and we re just going to kind of like this here is one socialpost and then this one up here is one and this down here is another so those are three different posts and you will notice again i openly admitted i was a fan girl they re all very heavy on supernatural i have zero supernatural fans in my stream i thought that i would and i was actually hoping to have people that were maybe more serious fans and that s not the word i m looking for but people who knew the the series maybe more than i did to kind of help me with us and i didn t i didn t getthat hot all at all interestingly with this type of advertising i did get a bunch of monster fleet fans though so still very very helpful now to give you an idea of what kind of help people are giving me since like i said nobody hears supernatural fans so nobody here really actually knows the universe very well i set this up so that all places are real i will literally go into google maps and i will find places anybody have found is that audience members get really excited to tell me about about their hometown or about where they grew up one of the first sessions that i wrote took place in new england and there s this resort there that s really old it s been running in one capacity or another since the late s and i wouldn t have found this place but somebody came into chat and they re like oh hey there s this resort next to where my family goes camping and and told me all about the local laura and i made an entire campaign about it i ve also and i just realized as soon be spoilers because casey is in my game there s also going to be a a session at the winchester house at some points you can come back casey um and i will have i will have one in milwaukee i m also thinking of doing one from just a west to me the bray road beast is a werewolf story from wisconsin yeah and this has this really got people excited which makes sense as an anthropologist i know people really love talking about themselves and i do too i m not bashing anybody but it s been really really helpful i ve also gotten a few people who have d end games in monster of the week which is also been amazingly helpful because i have people come in and i ll start doing something like okay well if i m writing this vampire how do i balance this with the team makeup or um how do you you know how do i fit this into the lore or these other questions because again i ve never put together this type of game before so nowi m this is just to give you an idea of whatkind of like what one of these streams look like so this clip is about one minute i think i guess i have time to do this so i m just gonna play this for you real quick cool do either of you want to walk in the room obviously obviously we kick the door down doors blah blah blah blah so guns blazing but yeah done strong ready to go charge you then i don t force your losses now um okay so that was not that was not in gameplay i know it looks a little bit like it but i will bring audience members in sometimes in order to to test something because again i had never run combat before and so i was really really nervous and i had people you know no problem come in yes i would love to help you and i m not sure if you could tell by the accent but this person up here his name his screen name is john summer he stayed up very late after working a full day doing his own stream and then coming into my stream because that s how much he was excited to help me as a new gm practice what i needed to practice and i also found it really whoops i also got it really exciting because i have this international knowledge base to draw from now i have just one more slide that doesn t want to come up which you do ina commercial side just because i want to i don t want to misrepresent what i was doing so i feel like that clip is a little more exciting than what most of these streams are most of these streams are actually me writing and me talking out loud and thinkingwhile i m writing and having audience talk to me while i m writing and so these are just neither of us are videos the screenshots and what you see right here is i make a newspaper if you know the show then you know that to the brothers find cases by looking at newspapers are looking for new stories online and that s how they choose where to go and so for every new session my players actually have a choice they have three different places that they could go and which also means i have to bevery prepared because at the start of each one i have to be prepared for three different storylines depending on what they will choose i photoshopped this whole layout and everything from scratch i was a little nervous about it i was a little nervous about streaming it also about this part over here nervous about this for the same reason these are just these are notes these are what the characters have been doingthis is you know i m like lining things up turning grids off and not and making sure everything looks like a real newspaper like actually put a lot of attention into that detail and i was really afraid that when i started photoshopping on stream um that people would leave but they didn t instead people just double down and they re like oh this is awesome why don t you try this font or have you thought about you know this layout or i ll ask questions like you ll notice the the the newspapercost and i am somebody google that for me i was like hey while i m writing this article can somebody please look up how much a newspaper was in because that s where we are right now on the campaign and people loved it people just hey and that helped me do this work and it s great i also feel like this so this is not the only and i am seeing time so i ll be done in a minute i also stream a couple of other newbie streams where i m learning to code and whatnot and people have really taken to this i can t tell you why but it is also shared production and the other newbie streams andchat is also getting into this i love it um i don t know part of me thinks that maybe we re all just likes to be reminded that people are human that we all start out not knowing whatever the thing is and that s fine and i think maybe for me thisis especially helpful because so much of my time online or offline is dr malone the professor who is the expert and blah blah blah blah blah right and like very much on and then at the end of the day i ll come in and i ll do these newbies streams and i ll do this collective storytelling in my pajamas because if i m going to not be the professor i might as well not be the professor and it works out better than i could have hoped all right i m really bad at conclusions so we re just going to call that my conclusion and i am going to send it over to kc beautiful thank you for that thank you for that um so just bear with me one moment while i share my screen i m going to be looking up a lot because i have my notes up top and you know my screen is going to be shared with y all so give me one second i m screen sharing i want this up here so i will not be able to see to see chat as a heads up so krista leah for any reason people are like yo please talk to me right now or i have a question like i need you to interrupt me but anyway i m casey james and i m going to be talking about the transition from streaming in person and a co lab through serious play and having to transition to streaming remotely not just from my home but from other everyone else s homes becaused amp d is not just a one person endeavor so the serious play co lab is a space that s sponsored by the university of wisconsin milwaukee through the seven center for st century studies crystal is one of the people who founded this organization and currently we stream to hours ofcontent a week it s primarily led by masters and phd students throughout the english anthropology and history departments and at the time of the transition i was the showrunner on doctors and dungeon master s a d amp d five a stream and i was also a co host for the arena which is an esports stream but a little bit focusing on the transition of the role moving from face to face to a virtual setting as a dungeon master the issues of access that we faced and the ways that the transitionimpact of storytelling and the way that i like to sort of categorize this into sort of what did the storytelling look like what what did the play look like and there were like three major parts of the transition first of it i call it sort of faceto face uncertainty the second one is virtual uncertainty and then the last is virtual norm so let me paint a picture so this is the part that i call the face to face uncertainty period where there were whisperings of quarantine and we were just hearing the term flatten the curve but nothing was closed down yet so it was march we had just gotten the news the night before that spring break would be extended for a second week to accommodate instructors transitioning to virtual doctors and dungeon masters met in person one last time the next day because at the time none of us understood the importance of social distancing nor there any mandates dictating us to not meet at that time even masks were still being deemed as ineffective by the cdc as a measure for stopping the spread and over here you could see you know it s it s you know we re all there we re all lively we have you know the mess of food and snacks we ve got the table up top everyone has their laptops and kind of you know dealing with their own sort of space hereit was always very cramped but it was still quite wonderful and at the you know usually the last half hour of play we have a discussion talking about game mechanics and storytelling and kind of going into the weeds of the sort of meta game ratherthan just playing and as a sort of tongue in cheek side off i asked you know hey any thoughts before we leave forever because we only thought it was going to be a week or two and corey goes well i will never be on here again and so you know oh no well worst case scenario will be streaming just for the next few weeks and eric goes well best case scenario they find a cure and here we are over a year later sorry there s construction going outside my house my dog has a lot of thoughts about that but we re just going to power through next phase of the transition is what i kind of consider the virtual uncertainty period because you know things were still very much up in the air we did not know what this was you know how long it was going to go for and sort of what do we need to do where we going to do a short term transition was it going to be something that we weregoing to have to be in for the long haul so we just sort of made do with a sort of week by week basis and because that s the death of a campaign is breaking and taking weeks off evil enormous even in normal times we did not take the week off streaming and that made the transition very clunky i was running off of a computer that could barely run discord let alone discord and stream at the same time so i had to like lift it up and have like a little fan underneath to make sure that i didn t roast mycomputer we hadn t even scavenged webcams and microphones from the co lab space since one there wasn t enough to go around to we weren t sure who should get what and three we didn t have a practice of having the equipment be left out you know they were it wasmeant to stay in the co lab it wasn t meant to go to people s homes and then none of us were willing to invest in headsets and microphones on what we thought was going to be a short term stint and there was a lot lost in that week and in the next comingweeks because we were still getting used to not you know not speaking over one another because we were unable to read each other s body language and see if someone was about to talk and then we got used to you know muting and unmuted and then like the push to talk options you would push it but there d be a little delay and so we got things cut off in the beginning or at the end and we went from a physical map that everyone can manipulate and miniatures on it to something that only the dungeon master manipulate and over here this map and many online maps at this point were made by artists through and you could support themthrough patreon so it kind of became like a you know a more into community way of indulging people who play people who put work and labor into either gaming playing or creating content so a lot of mapmakers so a lot more profit for that because people needed the online maps as opposed to you just by you know your wet erase map that you can just erase and right over a bunch of times and then here last but not least is what i call the virtual norm where most of the issues have been worked out and although things were definitely different we were able to negotiate the interfaces with comfort because we ve all been at it for about a year but over here this is a screenshot from october so we ve already been at it for pretty much half a year at this point we ve got the map over here we ve got us on camera at this point and over here we have the party wizard drawing a diagram on why fireball was the correct choice spell to use in a tavern full of both enemies and civilians and sohow do we get from there to here i ve been blabbering a lot sorry you have like one to two more minutes oh well screw me i m so behind so i ll talk a lot faster so pretty much it was about you know it s a lot about a sort of life imitating play play imitating life so i thought about it a lot in terms of a couple of anthropologists that inspired some of my work so making do from the practice of everyday life by michelle desert oh talks about using tactics to sort of make do with an environment that is presented to you you re sort of working within these rule systems and then it s quite a dramatic but youdo also create creative opportunities by working within what s handed to you and that s sort of what we did a lot with the pandemic with transitioning you know d amp d is tactical and it s an engaging way for players to tell the story of an underdog and find a way out of a situation instead of being able to lovely operate in a rule set and i m pretty sure everyone here has some sort of like underdog story from themselves from the past year that if you were to able to tell a story with a heroicnarratives like d d it would be able to present a sort of opportunity where you can kind of meld in and that sort of experience and then last but not least situational adjustments salif more describes them you know or rather than the situations for every occasion that a person thinks or says that cannot be done it s against the rules or violates the categories there s another occasion when the same individual says those rules or categories do not or should not apply to the situation this is a special case and we saw that with barring the co lab gear where we were trying to negotiate back and forth aboutproper sign out methods and this and all that stuff because we weren t sure you know how long does this for you know this is university equipment we can t just hand it out to people to us personally and then last month after a year of everyone just sort of cannibalizing all of the bits and pieces someone from out of state who s part of the cola was like yeah i need to borrow the ps it sounds like yeah take it it s been sitting there for a yearit s you know so now we ve had this new adjustment to what s going on so i m just kind of throwing in as much as i can and kind offast track to the end here i don t want to romanticize the pandemic or i don t want to want to like insinuate that life is a game and game his life and all that stuff but what i do need to convey as well a transition from face to face to online as hopefully a once in a lifetime situation that will be over by the end of the year of the learning process and frustration beers the process of the stories that we tell ittable collaboratively together we sit as a group we problem solve we engage we question we seek advice we give counsel we adjust and the technologies that came out to tell these stories through virtual play and the practices that became normalizedhelp create better access to those who otherwise would not have been able to be at the table people with chronic health problems parents of young children people without reliable transportation people with social anxiety and all sorts of others who wouldnot have been able to make it to the physical table can now join in the virtual format the stories that they tell through their characters based on their own reference of references creates a fuller game world and i daily a more accessible game world i m going to stop it there and next is our good old friend poke that s me hi everybody hi you re comfortable my name is edward flapjacks i ve been a dungeon master for plus years and a storyteller since the age of eight i d love to share my current storytelling project let s set the stage i believe that storytellers i ve been casting people into the stars long before we ve had rockets i believe that storytellers can start wars and have them i also believe that we are the stories that we tell ourselves that we ve all heard them things like you must have money to become successful you must be beautiful to be loved adults must grow up and stop having fun every time we tell ourselves these stories we put limits on ourselves slowly without thinking paralyzing ourselves i tell a different story i tell the story that love and success come from within that fun is part of a range of experiences that should be socially acceptable at any age in public i want to explain here a little bit closer what do you mean by our story imagine if you will a huge stone door and a group of people trying to open it imagine the first person comes up and looks at themselves and says oh i i don t have muscles i i can t open that door the next person comes up and says well i i don t think i can open that door but but i think we can another person might come up and say oh i am full of muscles i move aside i shall open the door this is the story we re all telling ourselves because in fact that door is painted styrofoam styrofoam that everyone could open it i am trying to tell stories to convince people to take control of that story to stop before they say i can t open that door and make a different choice tell themselves a different story so coming around to to table top storytelling it s vastly different than great storytelling because like in great storytelling and tv s and movies and books this storytelling is often has a degree of separation that allows us to vicariously live through our characters but characters that are rude or insulting or maybe even disrespectful to get their way oftentimes are entertaining on the tv with characters like house or tony stark but when sitting around a table to play it is always a character blown out of ourselves no matter what you do so like when we go to the grocery store we re all entering a social contract to not take a dump in the middle of the aisle and jump over to punch the cash attended in the gut i hope it s the same here i strongly recommend taking control of that contract talking to your players investigate safety tools and implement them in your game it s an easy way to make sure everyone understands what s happening and what you re planning to do my basic social contract for my games is i want to engage in friendly group storytelling hot tips do not include players phobias do not push players to do things that they are uncomfortable with there is so much story we don t need to tell these ones everyone still with me questions so i promise now here s some of the key understanding i ve been using while trying to get my players to take control of their stories helping through storytelling is about pace and i don t mean the pace at which players achieve their goals and succeed the game no i mean the pace that players choose to take actions for themselves i m talking about how often they find themselves bartering instead of just accepting the price especially to reach what i call the golden zone of storytelling at a table top this is where all of the players feel comfortable and validated in the attempt of anything in the game suddenly everything becomes easy teamwork flows story moves everyone at the table is exercising their ability to take control of their story i m not a therapist and know the end game should replace professional help but this kind of storytelling can be profound we can all make mistakes gamers the players the dm everyone we must accept these mistakes i ve made a few perhaps you can learn from this one when i was first setting up this project and making sure that i had set everything nice and well for my group i d overlooked an element in the game i didn t really see how that element would come across despite all of my players thoroughly enjoying themselves one player felt that they were unable to change events unfolding they felt unhappy they felt distraught later when they came to me i realized my mistake i admitted that i could have included that element in a better way because i was able to allow them to practice taking control of their story and i was able to practice letting them it s so so important to do both parts of that as the dm you are the arbiter of the world everything that happens the table starts with your choices whatever the story being told your players have lived entire lives away from you fought in one battles you will not understand or even know adventures in controlling our stories must be optional players need to choose to take control of their story but more than that to choose what to do with it building our story and our players so the attempt is is a celebrated as an actual success is a cornerstone of validating our players now this can be misconstrued as writing stories all about a rainbows and unicorns where strife is no more but no no this is meant to be a struggle we re in the group must take action in any way to hope that the group pushes further closer to success taking control of your story is a really tough thing sometimes as a dm you re controlling your player stories without even meaning to it leaks outin phrases like i m bad at this or i ve always been good at this the worst part of controlling someone else s story oftentimes comes in something like this you can t compare apples and oranges well the fact is that you absolutely can and there should be no one to tell you that you can tlanguage like this is something you should try to avoid using instead set limits in the environment putting terrain that will hurt the players the longer that they walk in it is a better border than saying no ultimately none of what i have said is outside of the wheelhouse of the common dnn the difference is choosing to do these things and elements as on purpose and with purpose as a storyteller you have the power and you shouldn t be wasting if you take one thing away from this talk it s that at the head of a role playing table holds power use it for good and use it on purpose make you everybody for the talk i think i think it s time for questions if i m not mistaken um yeah so we are going to take questions i just want to say real quick because mark graciously reminded me and a message that after this we can continue this conversation if anybody wants in the discord there is a channel for track three and i willdefinitely be there on and off during the day i m not sure about casey and poke i don t want to talk for them but hopefully they will also join us yeah i just want to say that before i forgot but now um any questions stream but then it ll be there this is also very early in the morning for me thank you aaron for the compliment oh how did gameplay change during the pandemic i feel probably all three have answers do you want to stop oh i d love to start yeah how did my gameplay turn changed during the pandemic but i just explained it to be honest i used to play games just to tell stories that i thought were cool but when the pandemic hit and i saw all of my friends will come downhill or feeling downhill i thought that i had one skill that i could offer and that was to tell stories that helped because i know how to do that so during the pandemic i shifted from just telling stories to tell them stories that mattered i would argue that all your stories matter but it s that s another conversation and um do you do you want to take a shot at this casey yeah because i think my answer is a little bit different in terms of the meta game thing the the main change for me for gameplay pre and post pandemic is that before the pandemic it became a way to hang out with the people that i already hung out with post pandemic it became a way for me to connect with people that i hadn t been able to talk to in a long time so now that we were able to gain virtually i was able to connect with my friends from when i lived in new york when i lived in london i was able to hang out with my sisters again because we all live in different states so that was the main change for me pre and post pandemic in terms of how the you know how it changed barring all the mechanical differences and i think we ll get to clara s after crystal he gets a stab at this one yeah definitely um because i know we probably all have answers that as well so for me game so the change in gameplay is also a little i have to do some contacts so i was playing with a group of people and somebody else was a dma and then what happened is that campaign ended and then we did a place has and the playhouse was online and honestly as a group so the group is stable but the game we were playing was not is basically what happened and it was actually very difficult for this group to transition online we had one person who moved to iceland which at first we were like oh this is great because he can still stay in the game but the time difference became too much so we had a person drop out and then we had a person get added and that was actually casey who had added after the fact and then that campaign and and because it was a play test it was also very rough and i don t think that that helps transitioning toonline right because the game was incomplete so then the gm that the person who had been jianming burned out on it as happens not a big deal and so i decided to take over because i really like to this group of people and so from for me jamming because it was online i went out of my way to find things that would work how i could find a rules light system platform and everything that would work for an online thing and so i for me i started from scratch even thoughfor the group it was this transition i ll just start with the tools used real quick and then pass it off to the others so for me on why discord which etc so i am running streaming experiments on twitch um when the pandemic hit i d always wanted to do streaming experiments independent kit i was like well here s my opportunity and so that s why i was using twitch for the prep as far as the discord for the game the the previous gm had already been using discord we were already set up there and it was working really well and in fact it was working better than rule was in a another separate game i m in that we re not talking about today the gm for that gamehad talked to me a lot about what it took for him to get that game going and it was a lot of work and frankly i wasn t here for it i you know i work full time as a faculty associate and i also stream a part time so between those two things i m already at to hours every week and so yeah no i was thinking i was frankly wasn t going to put that much work into it i put three hours of prep into the game that is how much time i have and that is how much time they getyour dog has thoughts on my time management she does she thinks that it is wonderful and that you did a fantastic job yeah you go poke fun i ll go after yeah i stream a dmv related content all week that s what i do and i use i use obs studios which is a how you how i capture everything a series of overlays and stuff that i ve made i use discord to talk and to use role as my digital table i find that discord is phenomenal not only just a talk but because you can make rooms in your lobbies and you can get channel notes you can post things in there for people to reference later you can have your characters and your players talk in there and be like oh i think i want to make a druid and that druids going to love to have pet insects i don t know it doesn t matter the point is it s all in there and it doesn t get lost in some sort of other place that is separate from all of your gameplay i love that i also use a digital deeming website digital damning screen website for quick reference info just to have it on the screen sometimes um i m going to throw my hat in the ring and say i love the ability to have discord now as a norm i m sharing my screen right now i cover it up but this is a couple of reasons why i think that online gaming became more accessible in the practices thatcame out of it so this is the discord for one of my campaigns as a general chat i m having these different rooms to be able to drop stuff in the campaign notes so that you know it s not relying on the note taker to be able to take write everything downyou could search things you could throw in pictures and then you can have like text role play channels between the different characters where they can you know kind of interact with one another in game in ways that they wouldn t want to take time awayfrom in game but want to build their characters separately and then also different voice channels to avoid meta gaming you know you don t want to tell the party member in front of the rest of the party that they re possessed and they have to pretend to be their character while being possessed so you drop theminto the secret channel pop them up and the players don t know what happened another thing about accessibility that i like is using d d beyond because one the dice rolling apps add up all those modifier is that make it difficult for you know new playersto be able to sort of know like why is it a plus seven what s you know what s the ac what s you know all these different things and you can also see everyone who s in the campaign what their roles are so that there s no sort of worry about who s fudging a role because i can tell you before we use the end beyond and i was dealing i had some players that like never failed an importantcheck and there s you know something that kind of feels bad when you worry about if you re one of your players are kind of like faking dice in their favor and you don t want to believe the worst and then but also you don t want to be like not reallyknowing what s going on likewise roll has those features with the character sheet all integrated just click a button and then you can see how all the roles that up and like what they were and all that love it love that that s it s i don t think i could ever go back away from a digital character sheet okay so i saw a question from aaron about time management and i think i saw that before i saw leonardo s a hand so i m going to go to aaron and then we ll go to leonardo aaron aaron s question was how do you manage the balance between time intensive streaming workflows and other research teaching service responsibilities in your experience so to start for me i kind of touched on that a little bit right so one of the things is i set aside a very specific time and i m like this is how much time that game prep gets and then it s not i do not work outside of that but the other thing for me and this is also kind of going to what mark said in chat about how i keep referring to these as experiments and that is because they are i write articles on this and i do presentations on i m teaching a class on game on tangential game cultures so none of the none of the topics are directly games but it s all the things around games so it s going to be about discord which these things so for me time intensive streaming research and teaching all overlap in a way that actually overlaps so much that over the last couple of years i have had to consciously step back and and learn how to do time management better because when you re when what you grew up with as your leisure activity becomes your professional life you have to suddenly console consciously decide when you re going to take time off right and so that is one of the ways i do that is like i said with this game i prep on stream and so that is part of my work but we play privately and so i do not i do not consider that research i don t take no i don t take notes for articles i don t talk about it in articles right that becomes something separate and not that i m great at it all the time but that s how i do it so poker casey do either of you have thoughts on this before we had to the next question absolutely no i have no self control i will just end all day like yeah eight weekly sessions and then i usually find a nine to join in d d becomes my social time in my reward time it s my decompression time that lets me do all of my responsibilities because if i did not do my leisurely things i would not do my responsibilitythings i think there s another there s another question here a couple of questions one what does can raise for a little we re going to go to him and then we ll jump back to jack thank you thank you so much i you know i m all conditioned with zoom in classrooms anyways i m raising my virtual head when i love the the how this moment that that we ve all been through and are still in many ways are going through has empowered the the the real social and connection and this the connection i m at i absolutely love that and fascinated by it the other thing i d love to hear from you all is is is the computational aspects of the in the another role playing systems which have been described you know like board games i think i thinkit was mac personal about maybe quoting someone else but described them as cardboard computers you know you have you have all these algorithms set in right you re rolling dice we re doing things that computers do really well and with the example wejust saw of of you know all the end management and adding all the stats for a role and all those things is really great so here comes my question like in what ways has this shift really kind of i don t know created more of a cyborg practice right where there s these elements like you know we re not really and and of course we ve done with other people we re neverreally in control of a narrative it s this constant negotiation and this this social thing right the social narrative but also you know there s the person who who makes the saving throw or or fails the saving throw or fails the critical or triggers the trap or the random monster or whatever right so so there s all these sort of alia tory elements that get woven in i wonder if that has increased with some of the the sort of greaterreliance on digital tools that kind of transparency that you know i remember rolling dice as dm behind the screen i had a little screen right and and and sometimes sometimes i just had to go with the narrative rather than what the what the directorsaid right but now we have this transparency right it s all showing up on screen and people know the outcome of the director so there s some of these challenges but then the other thing i m thinking of is i don t know bots you know bots as mpc right you you know characters and pcs are in fiction in traditional written fiction they are all we have is a record of what they did and said in something that s live and improv improvisational like role playing the character becomes a kind of algorithm you know how would this character respond to this situation right and these are very complex understandings of the character and what they would be that help flush them out in a way you can t do in just straight up written fiction but you can dosomewhat in bots right where you encode and program behaviors and then you set them loose and then they do and they surprise even us our creators right then frankenstein frankenstein monster metaphor right so anyways i throw a bit of a shotgun blast but but just to recap yet randomization digital tools bots all that all that good stuff love to hear what what you all think about this i solve this entire conundrum with three simple rules that i apply to all of my games and quite frankly they are the only rules that matter number one is that everyone must listen this begs everyone to actively listen to each other this is how you make group storytelling happen you can t connect story points if you don t know what they are number two you must include people in what you re doing the warrior might want to lift a rock because he s super strong but could ask someone for help that makes everybody connected and number three that you cannot win the end but we can these rules are the only ones that matter how the fireball makes sense landing is something that if you don t already know you as a dm can make a narrative assumption check it later the idea of meeting these rules and making the game run purely on the rules alone is actually more just the idea that it should be guidelines they should be helping you inform a consistent idea of what your world does that s the only purpose of the rules is to help you conform to some kind of consistency throw out the rules when they don t make sense to your story it s not to say page of the dungeon master s guide say make the rules work for you not the other way around so oh sorry sorry sorry i thought you re done oh no sorry i was i was commenting and then kind of pushing forward and um i think that if you give any role player a scenario where they have to deal with math and computational things that presentthemselves as taking story away will find a way to make it work for us for example i learned about the click rule when dealing with open rolling where the player knows they failed or something happened you know they triggered the trap and the dm goes you hear a click what do you do and you give them a chance to sort of like use their reaction to respond to that failed role and be able to still control the story even though the dice made the decision of that they fail but how they fail is now in their hands crystal league ahead um yeah so i was going to say a couple of things as far as the transparency we don t have that issue because in using because we re using discord everyone s we re actually rolling happy people i think are rolling physical dice and i roll physical dice you can hear it when i roll but nobody sees it so we actually don t have that issue what i did want to say as to the the botsthing real quick is this has become a very interesting aspect what you re talking about in my teaching of game design because i used to teach a analog design class i also taught digital but that was not that affected by the pandemic but for my analog class i had to put it online and what i found is a lot of really interesting uses of bots in order to create tt rpg or or board games card games because i told them they all had to do something that they would have done physically that became the new assignment but for the pandemic and i ve gotten some fascinating discord bots that have been either npc or have been the dm so yeah it works i ve been thinking about making one myself but back to the time management thing by the time i actually finish it since it s very much a side project i m not sure everyone s gonna want it anymore all right well we have had several questions i think the last one was well we all just kind of answered their there s what are you looking forward to return like what do you look forward to returning to and what doesn t translate into online play um i will say one thing that doesn t translate into online play is the snack experience because snacks you know sounds and like you know bags opening or like tolerable in person but like god forbid you open a chip bag when you re on discord with mei will mute you so fast and also i miss you know just being able to kind of have that you know that shared space and sharing snaps with one another i would host every friday and i bake a cake and once the cake is done i would put a little d hidden in one of the slices and whoever got the slice with the d got to roll with advantage you know kind of had inspiration that sort of fun little randomization i m sure you could do translated but it doesn t bring the cake to everyone you know so there s there s certain things that are missing even though we gained so much with us i miss the sharing of sex because we used to do is everybody used to bring a little something and then you had instead of me sitting here with just whatever i have i could like have little bit them all the things that everybody brought in and alsothe shared the shared spaceand comfort i guess it s really the thing so right now i m presenting from the same space idea in but i would not be here if we were in person because i would be upstairs in my dining room and so this one of the things i ve actually struggled with during the pandemic is feeling like i m notat work when i want to use my computer for other things because this is this is the workfare and the work computer and this is where i m here all day and i tried like taking a laptop and do something from upstairs but my laptop is fine but i have this like beautiful massive work machine so it s really hard to go from this to the laptop right and so i miss i miss the the not just the commodity of the people but also just not just being upstairs i m in a basement office it s dark and dank back here and spiders are everywhere yeah i think what i miss there s a couple of there s a bunch of things to be honest a back when i used to dm around a real table i would craft boxes with secret bottoms i would i would put paper in my oven and covered in coffee so that i could make a cool looking map and then you wax it because you don t want it to get wet when you re doing pirate missions that s the kind of thing another thing i miss is seeing people i have a hard time because i get so jumbled when i m playing that i just have to focus on what i m doing or lose it all of it i can t swap back and forth between i have four screens here and i can only look at one one idea so i can t look at discord i just see my map i have to assume my players are having fun i don t see their faces i have to go i have to i have to tell myself that they re enjoying themselves even though all by get in response is an avatar because some of them don t even use cameras so i missed that and the biggest thing i miss is books just tangible real paper flippin iknow i actually have a digital pdf of this and i came with the purchase of the book because i thought oh i will use this because it s online you know i sit there with this physical book and use this to look up all the information because yeah because i m a nerd right like i grew up in thelibrary was my favorite place was like i want the book in my hand and smell the paper i m i m casey i feel like you know a bunch if you want to start there it s funny cuz i have a lot that i want to listen to but then i don t and it got to the point where i m just like all right i m never going to listen to this unless i make it part ofmy dissertation so i have a list of shows that i listened to when i do my dissertation but unfortunately a lot of the popularized shows right now are you know primarily white dudes and even if even though they re like woke white dudes it s still white do so it s woefully missing people of color and women so like the adventure zone critical role or all popular ones dungeon your daddy s as well but once again very kind of one sort of demographic there is corso who is a creator that i encountered over tik tok who does fantastic content i ll see if i could grab his twitter handle so oh and then god sharif does rivals of water deep and he s a local activist as well so he s someone that i also would recommend as a fantastic human being i was on shrubbery if a jackson although he s moving so it s not gonna be local anymore you know it s kind of my job to just look at people on on stream to i watch copious amounts of d amp d content on twitch at least and i found quite a lot of cool stuff one of my favorites up and coming is a bunch of tech talkers that just went we re going to do stuff on twitch that s the large network and they re really supportive and i ve seen them supporting a lot of community driven dd content and just trying to like drive support to other communities in the same kinds of ideologies another group i really watch is a small group called carpe diem live they run their games on their channel but the thing that i love the most about them is that they re probably even doing it now we re starting shortly their podcast that they talkabout how they feel about what s happened in the game and i find it invaluable as a dungeon master just to get that insight that my players never give me because they don t even know that they have it because they don t sit down and digest what they ve experienced they do that on their podcast and i findit really helpful to understand the motivations of why they care about this or that versus this and that um so just briefly i i almost feel guilty saying this but i m already been honest about all the new breweries i ll go with it i don t like watching the nba games um but i love watching prep um so i actually watch poke your eyes out do prep on his stream and he s come in and actually helps me and then i also watch gambit do his prep he also streams games but for me twitch i like twitch for being interactive and when people are prepping i can be interactive with them and talk to them and ask them questions but when people are playing games they re not interactive during the game um and i have found that my problem is that unless i can watch every single session so i treat it like a tv show and i can follow the story then i don t want to because i can t follow the story and so it s not interesting and the problem with twitchis that there there s nobody who like i just i can t watch twitch that way because of work right so it s like i can watch tv that way because i like dvr things but then on twitch things i mean things get archived but sometimes for only two months and a lot of times like if i did treat it with the tv show it ll be four months before i can go back and binge it because basically that s what my summer and winter vacation are and so yeah i watch people prep and i love it and the reason this makes me feel guilty is because i personally have put out multiple game podcasts and twitch streams so i was in the original dungeons and doctors doctors and dungeon master s group becausethat s actually a handle that has been passed down as people graduate you know and so i was in that broadcast i was in ladies layers loggers which broadcasted on on twitch back in the day i also was in a podcast group where we did this and that s why i feel bad because like i literally produce these things for other people to watch and it s not a thing it s not a media that i personally like toengage and so to add to answer leonard leonard leah leonardo s question quickly sorry i also like i also want watch a tv show unless i can have access to episode one and all of the episodes after that i want it all or nothing yeah i do i do recaps and i knew them very differently sometimes i sat down and i say this is the recap sometimes asked my players to give the recap sometimes i refuse to give a recap that s when we go to the wilds and it s part of the story that it s hard to remember so recaps are just subjective you just got to know that your characters have a better memory than your players because characters have two minutes since the last time they did something and your players have all week go month maybe longer so yeah okay i think i lost my place in the chat questions now does anybody know where we are i think we did answer everything that was put in chat and we are also at like the you know two minutes before the next round of panels i don t want to be those people who don t know we have to do last call i bought tend to my way through most of grad school alright awesome it looks like we re just getting things you know last call all responsible people driving home i will be in track three for a bit
