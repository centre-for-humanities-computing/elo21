okay lovely um and shout out to kevin o brien who is here and the georgia tech students and my deep apologies i only have minutes and we do have a prototype but didn t quite fit i wasn t quite confident of it so this will not be in the exhibit but we will get there eventually this is chronic my personal santa do and it is written in both english simple version chronic and rose the complex reading here is a sea of surprise unexpectedness the age of joy and sorrow intertwine gold with the painful memories on top of the good ones oh positive intersecting the end of highest truth shattered by my love and i in time together to see again unconventional so this is chronic it is written somewhat in rose language about to and in grows every letter in the roman alphabet has a particular meaning a surprise to it and every one of those has two to different symbols that you can use to describe a variation on that so d for example is middle or close or far oh good or bad and i developed this language as a code when i was in high school so no one could read my journal and my dear love she wanted me to publish it so i m still trying the promise that sometime i will get this margie larson what a wonderful woman anyway this is a memoir and written handwritten pages julianne jewels channeling has helped me marjorie lucy brink and stephanie told me to write it and honestly you guys i am it s just taking me a lot longerthan we thought it would um the you can click on any of the handwritten pages to see the art so i thought that we would go through one of them which is i think ted nelson and we have a prototype yay that rotates the page it s insane it seems out and it selects so you can click on any of these links and we re texting shimmer and you can click on them this one no ben becomes right side up for those of you with tape recorders i am ted nelson with the first words i ever heard ted nelson speak in but there s also a shadow of rose and i want to read that complex forge to use the f finite touchy grinning but the e well time out of time to the positive emma gentle energy but you not understanding the word forget also t impossible of or more of good memories with joy and sorrow tape ilan pass coming into the end of deception recorders reporters the t possible but the p angry and i m just going to read this you do have in the real one of a way to read simple and complex and to tell you how long i ve been working on this i recorded all of the simple and complex in south africa in we re working on it i first met ted nelson at the acm hypertext conference in seattle i can t remember the past the topic we were fiercely debating but ted nelson strode into the room and let us know who he was before he gave his peace the p of anger i quoted from literary machines and my thesis sharing in his dream of text context that could be so much more than a string of words on a page rage or later a string bring of words worlds on a screen one after the other since my first encounter with ted i d heard him speak perhaps a dozen times i hear hear heart mt impossible is paying p of anger that we the ef then a long time ago could the d of distance have done so much we could have recharged really changed the way humanity thinks reacts and we didn t i ve always been intrigued by totes ideas so at the trace conference in i went up to ted s latest venture after his talk said well this works well w of strength some well this works well w of strength here ah of joy but this breaks are painful memories leaks ko give up already that s of change here sadness and if you did this you could get this but see how much this piece doesn t mesh here now our actual talk was some much more technical whatnot and nodding him ted and i stayed close closeted to his computer figuring out the angles now ted records and videos every moment movement t possible and impossible of finite his life and his has faults faults of these past notes it is a one to two impossible one mapping and i don t to impossible now if anyone will aspire spend and spire i or their time their life time em too much energy going through so much he asked about materials and took a picture and video i told him about my decision process developed my government job where teams figure out needs options and resources and arrive at mutually agreeable plans of actions so ted gets me in his car care to meet a software development team that night out and more in the others and we spend the entire night and it s notes and broken coffee makers of pizza crust and hardware and machines and his team comes up with an entirelynew plan planet tennis impressed him stressed with how his plan comes together and tells me to go into business with my decision making consulting yeah i decided to follow ted s t impossible he time out of time d so damn distant nelson s advice so i wanted to business as a change selling telling the g fat my decision process to a wide variety of businesses my business model model failed utterly muttered i am not a good salesperson p of anger i rebel reveal and ideas ideals not in dollars and i could not get she said he time out of time to impossible the hang of the profits and loss so i lost my savings savings as well now the irony the why so deeply vulnerable of following ted s advice life has never left me ideas before their time be at santa dd so distant and you so in comprehensible or rational rationale decision making i never profitable and i can only imagine the bitterness the order o o negative all her painful memories de close and get so far he time well out of normal time are again so painful to remind us of magnitude magnificence bitterness the s of change the ted must feel so that s my little vignette about chronic and chronic has started um we have the working prototype i really need a bit more help to make this a real reality we ve gone so far we ve done more progress this year than we have in years oh my god so we re past the abandoned where we re basically into the vaporware yeah we could make this work where and we re into the github development where i m which hashelped a lot and the people who have made this possible are georgia tech a print screen this so that you get katie shags email because she can help you get a georgia tech application for your own work but justin and undone and hassan and ebro hannah mitchell and kevin have worked so hard this year in getting me something i don t dare show because does break a bit and you know i don t know if we have any time for questions are gone over my time we have a little bit of time if anyone little bit but we have a question yeah let me know um and also many of you have had have had me have right there their names and rose language if you email me we can do that we have about that doesn t quite work that will also translate things into roads and i m i m not looking all the way down into the chat sorry uh yes it was incredible that the gt students were able to help me with this amazing print presence and katie has her email in the chat and again i do want to say this book is huge part of the issue is you know if somebody who s willing to work for what i can barely pay them on a government salary i my hands don t work well so i do need help getting all of these into svg code it s going to be at two to hours with the work so yes we re not quite at the full realization yet katie but we are so much closer thank you kevin who is here yay and katie thank you i guess i ll end with that thank you yeah never be a pioneer it s too painful i can stop sharing my screen i think i had this problem last time hope you guys were able to see my screen oh yeah we saw i just find it that was beautiful you may want to take control again in because what s been happening in my spine is i lose the chat window or i lose the zoom window out there it is stop sharing okay i got it thanks thank you so much tina that was so beautiful so it s so nice to hear you read that work in particular was looking at that texting me read it i mean it it opens up a lot of layers and it s just essentially yeah it s kind of fun because it is paper there will be a paper version someday and it s online and we re hoping for a phone version as well again email meif you can help at all i ll put it in the chat all right thank you again tina and i look forward to seeing them realized next up on our program we have another beloved figure we have david job a johnston job every reading this will be d platform is embodied years of clear ca yeah am i visible am i audible you are thank you dina that was so beautiful and to darien and chris like anyway so i have no idea about how to do performances on zoom i m going to share with everyone a dock in which they can put their chat comment because i find the same thing as alan those little chat comments that appear over the screen while i m working they just too bothersome so please have a conversation i ll be partially watching that document if you don t have an extra screen well i guess it s a problem i m going to do a quick share screen and hopefully this will all be audible and now i can t see anything right because i ve got a single screen so in you re going to tell me if this is going to happen is this happening it s happening and is it audible are we listening to organic website design and no topic any pesticides radiological toxins we are oh isn t that nice so that was have we gone anywhere like have we changed as we ve moved from these user configurable open apparatuses imagine the joy of arriving at a place where suddenly you could get words to physically move and thenthe depression that occurs in when you discover that you the corporation which sold you the software after you bought a cracked you have the correct version you bought the software and then they stopped potentially unsafe operation it feelsbut let s have a look at this unsafe world this is january this is the young carpenter working on like this open space of making things move around in strange ways and enjoying the way the waves open up awareness begins outside us and interest to die everything outside begins within us within us there is nothing nothing begins nowhere here begins now the structure of this don decaying nebula is perfectly more but relevant compassionate virtual violence is somehow hoarding everything within the interface and these interfaces themselves full of large files and images twitter nate files and mp is dead doesn t work anymore so the way i feel about the platform and the pandemic of the whole movement toward the infinite scroll is a we ve become enamored by the goddamn fucking weeds of corporate control and that sort of stuff is sprouting over us everywhere there s no way we can explore anymore we re morose and jubilant as we helplessly and hopelessly tried with a being killed by the corporation somewhere and this is why recursion is important why the glistening apparatus of built in code that you do yourself can be so helpful and that puts us into an interested ego region it s somewhere between the life and death portion and almost unheard in dissipation place where timelessness and time enter into a drinking state a place where we ve seen from as many angles as subjectivity will allow and this and then in that resolute silence the proceeds discovery perfection is born itself dies it s something i can t really speak of something just done without me within me and i lack in this first embodied moment the neural capacity to comprehend within this hijack brain of the platform of the body on calibrated sensors plasticity will be necessary identity congealed are in continuity death does not exist life oscillate it forms untamed desire takes time and then this week maybe understand that all code is going to die all of the bodies code is an ode and somehow in the super abundance of life things have lost their knowledge of things and now is his last and not a thing it s not a deed it s not dead it s somehow indeed in between words an action it s now here in the debris rolling along the generous infinite passage between virtual platforms where the blend this of propaganda and mental debris blow everywhere the hierarchies sproutanimosity takes root the scene polarizes so it becomes what you feel and feels what you become nice luminous lash accidents line up to become you memories ash interpretations fire what are we attached to careening reservoirs of molecules new nucleus strands cleaving like exit ropes clinging to the paper clinging to the certainty of an easy interface even as the lump that kills us that kills and clarifies the light of embodied for the hand and the heat all the heart of the hair and thethe hand and the heat all the heart of the hair and the skin and breath of love the smell of light the love that we share in knots the juice that fever asleep eaten the merging and writing all of it is play as we lurched in blind holding and seeking all of it is itching all of it is dna junk space crowds emptiness power accelerating discourse machines down immaculate recursive interested in singing this is an implacable paradox future of flexible pandemic platform and it s an adopter bleep solutions so space inside the social media i feel a little bit paranoid you know get your camera checking me how you you regarding what i m typing my heart rate my domain right you got it all worked out to him you and your voyeuristic malignant curiosity i want to buy that thing do i want to buy that thing going to click that i m going to put an end to it i m going to delete all my accounts you don t believe me well fuck you here it s done it s done hold on it s over hold on my left i ve left left i feel better i m not anywhere here i m with the pollen in the air i m gone you didn t think i could do it what does not change is a wheel to change what does change is the capacity to change the past the beat threshold what we see on the screen has changed our capacity to change it has changed just become geared the earth is offline they are therapists offline and into the purity of its forms along the rigorous provocations slouching like a sacrifice tentacles dreamand trillions of galaxies endless cells infinite infinities life is redundant reboot the universe now exponential increase information hemorrhaging you cannot keep up every time you click you hurt reboot the universe now temporal mental compressing time in a ratio of one to irrelevant moments obscured by seeming relevance effort in bent over backwards the trees are only tiny sprouts the sky appeal spore boredom begins here universal redundancy made more redundantsummer in full serene fury i build a monument to a dead cow put a photo of it on the plate glue the paint on the pole and then we enter into the mis transcriptions of survival traction and lead from air into species disconnected fragments of thoughts that scrutinize discourselike fragile seem strange to the shimmering light we try to pick it up we reach down into the exhaust fumes and find a slip of paper on which is written the history of earth as told by a star that is never had planets with tone and the following installation has been bruford durable audiences to the corporate branch of your identities core terrible tethered spores seeking threshold uncivilized audiences stern erotic dream debris dense emptiness a level to provoke vertigo the following review has been improved for listed audiences synthetic life neglected desk do not attempt this in your own holes you initialize foggier your life file is almost complete your is one your mind is when you re certain morbid devout locked pure devout closed resilient frenetic undecided in different observed schools and smiles dichotomies of time your light your light is war and war and death death is like a lock key to which you have not yet found why is it why is it why is it why is it why is it why is it so if we can understand oh we skipped that one if we can feel more we might feel the word congealed for two and eventually we might know that grace is arbitrary just an energy and fears or rivers just energies excitement even is monotony all that dopamine and serotonin being provoked it s just a storm somewhere over the tracks and even the tumors inside us generous complicit civilizations and truth ah let s look at that sack full of tongues paralyzed what is a human palpitating bulging breathing shaking shivering it s a machine it s a machine made for making more machines it s maybe a mind of your mind that s apparently scarred a mind apparently scarred by other minds it s not intriguing how the metaphor works how the metaphor is a meat core team rope i love you of course i love you the message is all massage glance at the captions data plumbing network neurology where it is it makes flesh extrapolations gazing backwards like a mythological blinds here i never really read mcluhan s books i only looked at them i just still the logo on your plastic soul i read the ship other people underlined it s not that i believe everything glenn said i know it will sun and wind breath and skin get over it so what if we were talking about the end of all no one life forms even as a note a quarter alone word mutation rainwear ellipses continues now that i ve been ravaged by an intense light that ticks along inside everything is different and everything is much the same i still have no idea what to say but i know how i am seeing increasingly i am saying it with kindness because the future is not cannot and will not ever be rememberedeverything come through you thank you thank you for those commentsisn t the same and so exactly exactly so imagine that the books all the books in the world are printed on your skin they re they re manufactured from your spirit they re they re set inside your body and that s a kind of raw war field of ancient violence andfleas and beauty that s guarding the mobile caves and this is kind of a norm isn t it but the calm nourishing ground being his ground in and we re firing we re firing we re firing we re firing fire clear smoke fireburning somewhere what is a lonely heart for not for itself alone to the questions answer themselves no wonder brought to a reckoning do might be a mild anxiety that arises from the arbitrarypressures that arise when you are placed into a cognitive apparatus placed into the devotional space of this very rare human body on this tiny little energetic and fluid planet with it formal languages having a near death platform experience watching the boulders covered an ancient glyphs and the gliding symbolic organisms glowing as they flow through your flesh everything is born here inside the delight that one feels as one is in folded by the fabric of being disembodied inside the ephemeral esoteric effortless fluid flowing growing grace of time what is poetry about i m not so sure but maybe it s about orgasms fictions trees windows consciousness perhaps it s the mandela of identity maybe it s an egg and ray are beautiful leg covered in language its self inflicted memories with fall shrinkage is it love versus hate hate versus love love and perhaps in this joyful era this epoch with our artificial intelligence toys will figure out loss and perplexity will initialize an incantation of fluttering morning plunging through the slow simmering juice mirror of transcendence it s the core of foreign stocks and blue bags and lifeless textiles it s a small epiphany of many forms estuary liberation power with no place to show and no need in this time ripeningripening ripening all of it is unstaffed gold bloom where the verses endlessly belong to the tips of our fingers nestor skin so has practiced it s balanced in her you can bend language and become the future so the digital boy formerly known as java is now officially
