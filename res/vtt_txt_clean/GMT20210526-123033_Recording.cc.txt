okay you started recording your conference i ll stop recording hello everybody sorry was that your jingle excellent thank you well welcome to track three of the yellow conference and our track is entitled speciality and environments and we have four speakers or groups of stickers today this room this this morning this afternoon this evening wherever you happen to be so the order i have you in on the program is some rather priya tea and different seven followed by boyd branch here to mirror ascii corey matheson followed by rich carter followed by andrea tropper so we ll stick to the order and see how we go does that sound good already so let s start out with some some other priya and deborah hello hello hi good morning good afternoon and good evening everyone i just share the screen i hope you all able to see my screen yes we can see it thank you i m going to present the presentation is titled as lost water remains key transformation of what escapes in two from past to present rooms shall fight basically this this term poetry is the result of our editors is sponsored project is still innovation in water scarcity and climate arabia in this project we study how the water bodies from this region climate to from british period to current how theytransformed and what are the implications such like water scarcity and i m presentation so this is humanity s history teacher these fields may look two different distinct fields but they have common fundamental approach towards creativity artistry literature produces creative walks mr humanity supplies creative method to study what s of humanity s disciplines coma and they can be part of each other for example this judgment is can are can you see or not the creative process of electronic literature for building its method organization production and dissemination and similarly since this to the madness in this tickets both digital born and which ties to materials by using digital technologies they can also be employed to study digital creative works so in such case we actually use digital literature as a method to as an effective urgency to the person and communicate the research this is findings to the broader publicso lost water remains key that is true python is written in dominant biological mother other fee and english by myself and the information about the waterfall is the poetry is also written by my school this friday has both d and d environments which are created in blender and adobe animate software and others the software as well and we kept reminiscent is the primary team of are disturbed by tree so this binary has various various entities like text maps animations and photos in general waterboarding so our primary resources for drinking irrigation and other economic cultural activities in the badminton gn how would the garden what escapesthe photos which we have taken during our field receipts show the current condition of water bodies and most i mean very few of them are like oh i m still in working better condition but a few of them are like very important will state so i but on the other hand the water testimonies which we collected from the local people not a cold ever blessed to have in the water escaped in the past so basically average interactive digital pipe dream and provide every visitation to search last waters cats created based on the historical and filter it takes and water testimonials it will also try the current condition what a sketch before turning nation and exploration the image you see i mean the first we have we have divided our additional pointing to poor primary layers the first one is historical maps this th century historical matter or kyrie national ibm scotland and we actually this based on this map tohave a project and the the shiny elements you see the image in the map the president the river which is called us new year which was one of the primary resource when in the past but no they will reduce you into like drainage mostly drainage due to urbanization and other pollution activities and the red shiny elements you see that is represent the water tanks or which actually created during that period which is almost likeapproximately years ago but most of the nights are disappeared and some of those drinking and really few of them are in working condition so the user will play with all these elements to know about the waters caps and water bodies and also they can also read the poetry along with all these things and we have also have created to be d environments of particular that are important what our goal is of the region based on our experience from the local local studies and alsofrom the historical and so the user can play with all these entities and and lastly you know creative for animation of the current condition of what escapes so as you see the different kinds of photos also represent the temporary situation of the water parties and the the user or the pain can also interact with thesephotos and poetry a vision which will be embedded with this course so they can understand the situation the current situation are the main aim of this poetry s to create permissions on the earth of our public and we will be sharing this districtby create over local schools and colleges and we are also collecting feedback from the students and public and all of these feedbacks and disturb it will be hosted on our website thank you thank you very much that looks like a fascinating project alrighty so we should hold the questions and comments until the end but if you have a question while you re while you re just thinking through and listening just feel free to drop a q or a plus in the chat to let me know you d like to ask the questionat the end and if you have a question but you don t want your voice recorded you can also drop it in the chat alrighty so next up we have word branch theatre murawski and corey matheson hello i m boyd branch how i m i m cured me lawsky and we re hailing from spaceship and probiotics we re going to be talking about our project called virtual director and rosetta code so since we have a short amount of time we won t jump into our bios to extensively but i m at university of kent and i do research and to tell immersive theater and i m a research sciences at declined and in my spare time i do improv with robots within probiotics just a question do you hear an echo when i speak oh sounds good sounds good okay perfect so we re going to give you a brief sort of background of what the virtual director project was and then we ll talk about briefly one of the projects that we engage the way of using this software so many live performers struggle with the desire to be live and in the moment as possible while dealing with the physical impossibilities introduced by virtual improvisation the laws of physics that is the speed of light defines a theoretical maximumfor the speed of information transfer this is the maximum rate of which information from one performer can reach the other performer or an audience observer so an audience of performer or co located in a theater this language and this information can happen at the speed of sound for jokes laughter and applause at the speed of light for the body language and scenic painting performers are not co located however with audience members it takes an insignificant and not insignificantmost platforms must be designed in such a way to handle issues of latency and lag introduced by these delays and as the number one rule and comedy is timing handling these issues effectively is paramount for translating the comedy from the performer tothe observer so theaters around the world have tried many different ways to incorporate live and pre recorded content for performance hosting an audience interaction but the platforms often stand in the way rather than uplift those engagements andso these tools need to be easy enough for performers to use and improve audience enjoyment so to handle these requirements we built this platform for online performance so that we re calling with the virtual director which enables actors to simulatefeelings of being present like peter and i in a space together with each other so our research combines cinematic and video communication technologies with a theatrical practice of improvisational and scripted theater an aimed at recreating presence virtually so virtual director relies on commodity software in this case touchdesigner and web browsers like google chrome to wide and widely adopted video conferencing tools like zoom or microsoft teams for our solution so we essentially piggyback on the digital media platforms for streaming and video conferencing for participating online with these performances so this makes using the tools easy as essentially using just your common software they can get off the shelf these tools have evolved significantly within this year of development and global dependents for telework andremote education to software such as open broadcast software and even zooms google meets capabilities have improved significantly in this last year so full system description is sorted out of the scope of this particular work but for those of you that are interested in you have a few different publications that go into that so peter is now going to talk about one of the projects that we used us with the software yes so we are international theater troupe we have cast members from multiple nationalities and languages and again explore multilingual improvisational formats with live translation and speech recognition envelope and the appropriately no code michellerosetta code so we use the google api for speech recognition real lifetime translation and text to speech generation and he built a program to listen to improvisers speaking in language foreign to her partner and to send them near real time translation the headset as well as displaying the result of spiritualin real time on a screen that show was initially staged physically on the on an actual stage and then embraced the possibilities given by online our shows to have real time translation appearing on the screen in speech bubbles above the performance so that performance could speak in one language have the language translated into another language and then communicate with a second performer who would speak a third language and then communicated back into this lingua franca shared between them and our system takes advantage of virtual environments in order to provide a cohesive narrative experience and the context of this multilingual improv appearing in the same virtual location so i think we are close to the end of the talk because we timed it at minutes and we condensed it in real time to five boyd indeed rehab so we re happy to answer questions at the end of the session for more information and we do have a paper associated with this this talk that you should be able to access and we would love to thank the organizers of this conferencefor this opportunity thank you hey take keep both flaws friday okay next up we have richard carter with executable landscapes hello thank you let me just share my screen i ve timed my time my presentation at five i sort of five minutes seconds so hopefully will be a be just within so if i bring that up hopefully you can see my my powerpoint there and let s let s make a start then so got five minutes i m going to be very fast in essence my papers predication the question that interests me a lot digital art and literatureand i think this poses many important critical questions these practices can be more they can mean i m particularly interested in i explore this my paper how can digital literature help chart different spectrums of futures concerning digital technology so in other words how can it help us think through what kinds of activities or artifacts or infrastructures might emerge if the latter took took on board and active radically upon the critiques to which they were often subjected to i m particularly interested what other forms of knowing and being might be realized by digital sensors and data driven loads of sense making our environment is profoundly predicated on sensory systems and data gathering to function there s many things that those systems fail to capture about the world i m interested in how how they fail but also how they can also be used to explore explore those aspects and make us think about them so i mentioned a few projects my paper waveform is one i ve talked about a lot before it s actually drone poetry using machine vision to pause ocean waves into a form of poetic text now the projects i m working on is called orbital reveries and that involves landsat satellite images that are also passed using machine vision into a form of text escape so using text and image to think about the limits and potentials of the sensory most of my paper is on my latest project called land form so we have top down landscapes like you kind of see on the powerpoint here that are then turned into the circuit as visual algorithms that are then compiled as a form of esoteric programminglanguage which would then use to generate sort of json text arrays creative arrays of text so you might have an initial i can see on the side of the screen here and the system will then turn it into something looks a bit like this using looking at the shifting brightness values of the image and then tracing it that i can instruction point on a visual program into the sort of diagram matic structures that you see these structures can then be executed they can be read by an interpreterprogram to generate text structure of the kind that you see on the right hand side of your screen here so effectively then the landscapes as they are enacted at the intersection of the sunlight camera lenses the actual sensors and the script that kindof binds it all together they are treated as constituting a structured schema that translates into specific composition structure the result is something a performance and acting a platform of sorts that s made up a very landscapes flying vehicles cameras web canvas graphics and text files all doing things that are far removed from what they re typically used for and certainlyworking together in a combination that you don t usually see so i want to stress here that the search is not for novelty in the abstract or for definitive answers or even to preordained what questions we might even ask but bring together in an unpredictable unruly entanglement different systems to see what wemight learn from them in the process as usual so failure and breakages and uncertainty is characteristic of this kind of undertaking and is often actually more interesting we learn in the process why they re breaking what might come out of it for me the kind of the breakage is failures that i found particularly instructive i found when presenting this work across different audiences in different forms there is a problemof translation some people treat it as art some people treat it as research but it s difficult for them to see in both both sides at the same time as often issues there when they want to interpret it one way or the other there s a bit of an ai problem as well a lot of my work people want to let them certainly members of the public want to treat it as a form of an ai demonstrate demonstrate of ai technology and it isn t and i don t even think that ai is all that interesting either so i have to often preface what do i do quite carefully say this is not a i this is algorithmic but it s not quite the same thing and there s certainly when i m presenting my work in forums focused on environmental concerns environmental issues there is a certain resistance drone satellites databases do not come to mine so readily with thinking about ecological issues i ve often found that these systems are proceed actually is a numerical to environmental concerns the digital has enough privilege why should we have even more digital here so i often have to frame what i do quite carefully in those contexts as well to get us to think about well how can the systems that were embedded within and shaping our world how can they also contribute to getting us to think about these issues one of the same time reworking the fact that they are premise on often quite problematic predicates in terms of their functioning and they use us in the contemporary world as a longpaper associated with all of this so i don t want to take up any more of your time thank you all very much for listening thank you richard that s a beautiful and it isalready finally up we have andrea trouble on a narrow graph ef i m saying that correctly hi can you see my screen yeah yeah we can see okay thank you so i would like to thank the organization of yellow and the opportunity to be here to debate with colleagues as i m a brazilian and my mother tongue is for today s our own try to improvise so i will read the paragraph p so when they get a fuse and interactive do the work that proposes a reflection on the role of dreams in our lives created from a research initiated in during the code coverage pandemic the work began with internet searchers on a particular dream subsequently this creative process became an investigation into the atavistic relationships that the human species when faced with dreams and observed the different meanings that this state of mind has acquired throughout our history then in january of this year i invited the colder whose college philippa media need to work with me and then we work at the line for about three months to have the first version of on the graph here i will show you a video so you ll know how itlooks like can you see just a minute sorry i m just changing the screen to show oh sorry i didn t share the sound sorry yeah now i think it s allhere to present on a little bit of fear a digital interactive work about the role of dreams in our lives after receiving a welcome message in the chosen language of form will appear you must fill in the blanks with some details about the dream you want to remember or to create it is time to choose between the door of the nightmare or the door of the dream now we are at a d environment where we can access the messenger which is a community message streams around but i do live in by the current of guys if you follow the light spheres and click on the big guy you ll be taken to the word search here you must choose exactly three words that are related to your dream finally you ll get an image with results and effects that are procedurally generated so the dream merges images chosen the word search and the phrases written earlier from there it is the user discretion to recreate an a dream randomly using the elements of that same navigation are going back to the beginning of the process to makeother options for reports and word choices so that s it thank you i will put the link if you want to play thank you very much on dry that s fascinating that s fascinating all right well thank you all for keeping to your five minutes each much appreciated before we start in on on questions please just just drop an applause or reaction into your zoom so that screen so we can all see the appreciation that we have for all our speakers today i know it s a tough tough environment thank you very much all right so um for question time if you d like to ask a question and you d like to ask it yourself you can drop a q or a plus in the chat and if you d prefer for me to ask it just you can direct message me or or just drop it in and we ll see what happens i do have a question to get us started if there aren t any other burning ones right now and that is about the way your position your projects and this is this is something that i thought of when general korea you were presenting and you talked aboutdigital humanities and digital literature and electronic literature and i m just wondering if you ve presented this project in other places have you had to position it differently for say a digital humanities audience then you have for an electronic literature audience i haven t this is very first time i m pressing thing about this project and what this digital library i just completed the first layer and second layer last week so yeah and be presenting continuouslybe there are you hopeful i m hopeful i don t think there must be much issues but maybe we ll have some good questions when they come toconferences i do hope because the aim of this district bystudents and and because we are engaging in july so they will also belike to theplaces we do hope even create some impact into them so on so forth escape thank you thank you the non human thing it s say all right i think this might be a question for richard as well since you mentioned translationpositioning your work yeah so it is it is very interesting and i think it depends i present my work to quite a few different kinds of audience and the nature of it lends itself well to public audiences because it has a strongly so creative aspect to people s i m in contact with a lot of visual poets and artists who often do that performances and certainly the issue of the ai problem as i call it is a big one in those context and a half now now have to deliver something of a disclaimer at the start of everypresentation this is not a i in fact it s very much actually being quite critical of certain aspects that are driving ai but what ai doesn t know what do we even mean by and that s quite important as well from when i m talking to audiences and ecological forums because even though many of them are very academic forums there is still there s still a sense that ai is the enemy the paradigm of ai is the enemy of the fits this is this is part of a wholeway of looking at the world arrests it into matrices of command and control and absolute quantities of data and form and those things are seen as indeed inimical to the kinds of more subtle embodied entanglements which many of them are much more concernedwith exploring in their work which they do so through walking and dancing or poetry and performance and so i don t i can t say that i have a magical answer as to how long they re supposed to reconcile those things except to have to have to positionreally quite carefully so he doesn t come across as a crass we look at these wonderful new fancy bits of technology i put together on a wonderful on a novel is if i m pitching to a silicon valley audience so there is a lot of there s quite a bit of care and quite a bit of translation that has to go in and as i mentioned at the very end i think those those acts of translation or the act of trying to translate them anyway are really quite provocative becauseit makes you understand your own work a bit better makes you understand way what the field is that you re working in and as i mentioned failures and breakages are okay i don t want you know some people just see what i do is bad art and that in itself can be quite instructive as well for thinking about how we understand all these different topics all these different aspects and so it s that it s those conversationsthose negotiations between different disciplines different discourses and different technologies that s where that s where things and that s where the interest happens the actual assemblage itself may not really be all that interesting is the catalystfor those conversations that s my piece on it anyway thank you all right we have a couple questions in the chat the first one is for andrea and the question is andrea did you get inspiration from other navigable environments by brazilian office iactually am not i think that the d modeling came from philippines which is a quote that came from the game s world so i guess that s the thing i first inspiration were the dream life narratives and then we ll try to put it in the d modeling in as he came from games i think that he had some games concerns like how you would clique and how you would navigate and then we just melted all the things the narrative concern that was mine in this kind of game being that was his thank you scrolling through the chat the next q i have here is from sarin yeah thanks so i guess my question also follows up on what richard just said and it s that s it s a question to sort of send luca and richards pieces mainly which is of course you which would you address the criticism towards technology ai etc environmental areas and and and to to a lot of in a lot of ways that right right you know we have this we have this eventhough the statistics are hard you know the internet and cloud computing including what what we own now even though it s probably better than trying for the environment it s it s it s still polluting quite a lot and they say that you know the internetand and cloud computing etc is at the level of of flying when when when you count on the global the yeah the pollution carbon pollution so so in that sense and and but but of course you know that s that s a that s been our question or should we stop using computers etc but i would say the more interesting is whether you know the the way the functioning of these systems are these technologies these platforms is is somehow hiding the pollution forests are hiding you know you can see a car that pollutes but it s very difficult to see the pollution that soon causes right because it s happening somewhere else and and and and this fact that you know when all netflix as much energy as cooking boiling eight litersof water you know where do you see that and where do where do you choose between how could you even know as a consumer that maybe apple s streaming services are better than amazon streaming services and all this kind of stuff and so my question is probably on my question is you know how is it the sort of solution areas illusionism you know that that the fact that these technologies sort of it and then they work and no this sort of solution is not the technology is that the problem and is that also where you can see your art coming in you know you also spoke to talk about disruption now what can i really do in this field show movies she wishes to thank you for the questionbeing asked like in every other field there are there must there is always like both sides like negative and positive sides but absolutely currently like if you look at the positive side it s much more higher than the negative side because in thistime to make well it is the least helping us like walking origin or people and other many activities that is actually i feel is right goes to him so i can i m just feeling a comparison here boy it s not much relevant to the electronic age show from my experience please though a few decades before tap water is huge and people really liked it and they will come and every quarter and go and everything but it s like becomes more and more they started using technology to extract the water more than earlier but latter now we are realizing that how much that affected the other side like we are just forgotten our water bodies like tanks and channel streams because we are focusing only extracting water from the so in that case so everything the negative side we will realize on the latter not not know in that case how can we use art as an as a medium to connect with people are cutting the shoes um it can have more impact than we imagined so far from my experience so i actually did a couple of presentations not exactly a booster party that i created but just in general so that shows that people are like very much interested to see mr pine tree and they like it they can feel the connection between the ritual party that will create impact about the pollutions and on so i m not where i m going but that s my answer this follow up very very briefly i think you know i think it is a very interesting question and yeah there are times the answer is well this is to stop using computers and somehow things are going to be better and of course well maybe that s not quitewhat s going to be the case the way i often characterize my art and these conversations is is partly through i ve used the term resistance before and i m not sure if that word carries too much baggage for what i m trying to do because it s used in very particular context in particular ways but nevertheless i think this idea has been spoken over various theories the idea around things like glitch aesthetics the idea of breakdowns and technologies making us realize their how they function how they operate and indeed to get away from this smoothly functionalsolution ism is always an app for that there s always a beautiful flowing interface that delivers to us the world in a nice clean neat packaged form and when allergies fail or breakdown or indeed you produce works whether it s doing very very strangethings makes you think about the technicality of it it makes you think about how it functions and makes you realize it s an artifact in the world now of course i have always been quite frank i don t believe my art there s there s been some are goingto that i take a lot of i think a lot of inspiration from the climate science is kate marvel who she who says the coverages the resolve to do well without the risk of a happy ending and i really like that the idea that we do things not believe it s going to necessarily save the world and terrible ruin but nevertheless we don t give up on it because every at every step every conversation every stage matters and that s how i tend to think about what my work is doing if it s doing anything is to try to encourage those conversations different ways of looking at technology sensors and data not just for what they are but for what they might become what theworld s might become irrespective of whether that s going to lead automatically to a wondrous future well that s so has a bigger conversation but as part of that all right i see a couple more questions in the chat first we have mark you had a question about isa lang are you there okay maybe i ll just read another here sorry oh go ahead i was i thought my next question would do its work a look here him richard can you just talk a little bit more about the esoteric language that you felt absolutely i mean i don t i don t make any big claims that it s that is most wondrous of the selections you ve ever seen or is doing something especially exotic it as so lines go but the idea there were certain ideas taken from that you know pit which the one where they re all quite sort of quite familiar with probably in that world the idea of using a visual trace across colored blocks to draw your for the instruction pointer and what iwas doing slight variation of that but without rambling on and on and on the system instead of it goes through each block of the image and it registers the shift of brightness values and continuous continuous brightens blocks and he uses them as vectors for whether the instruction pointer changes direction and to what extent it keeps on going forward before it then rotates through again and there are a couple of strange there i ve met yesterday called revisit the same place already gone to so that s where you get this sort of looping labyrinth sign look and what happens is the system then reads the directions of the various vectors taken by the instruction points where i guess ultimately and then uses that to decide for which lexicon it s going to draw a set of words is it going to nest the arraysare going to keep on tracing through an array of associated words or is it just going to spit out a long block and in simple terms that s how it composes the end result effectively so i wouldn t say it s it s nothing that sophisticated but nevertheless it was as good as a good way as i could to create an interesting combination of outputs and also to makethe code itself would use on the looks quite interesting because i m interested in diagrams and how we try to arrest the world makes sense of the world dying dramatically and its relationship to digital systems and how they function as well i can go on and on and on there s there are there is thoughts here on just me throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks but but that is that s the basics of how the system works it s fantastic thank you very much appreciate it all right we have a question from alessia for andrea yes thank you good afternoon everyone i m andrea i liked very much your presentation and i was wondering whether an element of the went into the development of this dream nightmare landscape might be the answer ensemble of dream theories so including cognitive theories of dreams we can go back to avoid but also from the physiological perspective for example there are many theories on what the survival value of dreaming might be so how am i dreaming have evolved to be an essential part we know from for example my mind s experiment thatpreventing an animal from sleeping is not as legal or illegal in in such a short time range then preventing an animal from dreaming so if you let an animal sleep but wake up every time the animal starts screaming and of course there are ways of knowingthat through electro insect philosophy and then the animal dies in the matter of hours or i don t remember exactly the data but much much shorter time range then just depriving it from sleeping itself so thank you thank you and i sat yes i was doing the dream theory since the last year because i had a very strange dream just in the beginning of the pandemics it was a nice dream but very strange and i was really obsessive about it so i started to to research on that particular dream but then i started to think about how that dream made me survive during the pandemics because i was started to read a lot of things i started to research and then i guess i felt a little bit happier and wanting to move on but then i started to focus more on the this kind of procedures of dreams i wrote an article last year and i had some some some things to to reflect about some theories i have read about psychology but also about neuroscience and then this year i started to research on the the role of dreams for indigenous people so i will right now another article with this research i guess more profound i guess i will write it next month maybe but in this presentation i focused on the environment but it has this kind of research behind thank you jesse just very quickly add to that i think that s really interesting i found your patient rare really interesting to think about when you because you ve alluded to in your paper about the role that dreams have played for people to try to make senseof their environment so i m often when i think about sort of sense making through the ages i tend to think about actually to cave walls s of thousands of years ago when they were drawing animals in their hands on the surface and the way we ve triedto make a try we tried to understand what were those activities meant and now from that the the notion of dreams has come up quite frequently in the discussions of people studying that work and so i think there s actually an awful lot there s a lot going on there and your piece and making us think about how we use dreams to make sense of just what it means to be and certainly what does it mean to be alive in the teeth of a pandemic hasa certain very strong poignancy so i really look forward to that article that sounds fascinating thank you richard yes in my mother she used to tell me about her dreams every day and then i kind of pay attention to my dreams and then i started to research on some theories that say that this is really important and we should create a kind of dreamy airy so we should take notes of our dreams to think about what they are saying to us not in a kind of mystical term but in a very practical way is something that is telling to yourself so that s it thank you all i think we still have another minutes or so for questions but mark has also reminded me that if you want to continue the discussion you can do so on discord and the track three channel i haven t been keeping up with this code but presumably thismakes sense to you so do feel free to do that do we have any questions from the panelists for each other i know you were asked to prepare something possibly though i don t have any questions but i really admire others walks that that was really wonderful and very much appreciated and fantastic thank you thank you for sharing this oh definitely second that one absolutely i think i think the thing that when i m speaking a lot so tricky this quick but we will got some very different different approaches to this question are they and that variety is really interesting trying toto draw connections between them is we have an unusually broad array of different set of difference of platforms and structures that we re putting together for different ends i thought that s a dialogue is sort of really interesting i was just trying to think actually as one for that for the first team working also be improvised media there was a question i was thinking about asking them actually so pete or and what have you one of the things i saw when it comes to performance during the pandemic and way performance responded i mean i certainly saw modes that talks about using vr so some people were doing they actually just shifted their performance wholly to a vr environment and that was obviously useful as certain audiences but not others and then there were other performers who just simply went over to just doing a podcast they just they didn t actually want present physically they just read the lines and did the messinessof radio play so i guess i mean those seem to be the most common responses that i saw so forgive me if this sounds like quite a silly question but i m quite interested what made you think wouldn t it be good if we could somehow create these telepresence performancesand zoom what do you think is really brought to the table there for doing this kind of performance what do you think the real crux of the real benefit of this kind of arrangement for thanks for the question the first part of it is you know i do it and i guess for me it s because all the other experiences are terriblein an online performance is painful and it is largely an exercise and i don t know sort of star trek ask no exit approach to you know trying to make meaning and then connect with others nevertheless we re very much embedded already embroiled in inherent need and desire to connect and so we work with the means that we have i m being sort of cheeky in that response but ultimately you know before the pan dammit technology has been already always embedded in the way that we connect with each other the opportunity to have a deprivation of our normal modes of communication became something exciting for pr and i inquiry where since we re already kind of thinking about how language and communication and arts in our in our practice improvisationaltheatre is affected by technology and gave us an opportunity to really dive fully in and this is where we started to kind of parse out well what are the specific aspects of of performance that are vital to sort of embodied ness and and being presentwith each other and what can be parsed what can be dissected into you know the the binary of of a digital communication one of the things that kept on emerging was the sense of presence itself and so the system we developed was not so much a desire or expectation that we could like fix the problem of performing so much as an opportunity to explore the nature of presence which inherently requires accessibility as you asked this question aboutvr and of course sure that s great if you have a headset even more important that s great if you haven t a gaming computer that can actually process graphics at speed where you can have an experience if you ve spent any time in these spaces you know that s a very tiny tiny amount of people it s not accessible it s like a dream you know nightmares and dreams if you want to look for a connection i think the dream of what technology can offer isvery much answered and how much effort we spend and the utopia of what could be so we wanted to build a platform that could be now and that is we re all looking at screens all the time can we do something about the way we felt present with each other you know i m talking to myself right and i see myself in this box i see you in boxes i m sort of with you but to be honest i m very much not i m very like i m i m spending so much cognitive effort to stay with you right now one of the aspects of that is the environment itself the aesthetics of how we connect were biologically trained to survey information in a certain way and so our platform kind of emerged as a desire to see well how can we strip away the extraneous the boxes and see what happens and emerges when we bring each other together in a visual co located space thank you very much and that s pretty interesting and if i could add to what boyd mentioned i believe that one of the fundamental philosophy and our approach is to take a symbiotic relationship with technology rather than go with the easy route of adversarial exposure so richard alluded to that a little bit so we started in robotics five years ago as doing improv with robots and very quickly the intro of community picked on picked on the idea that it was not a replacement it was basically a new tool for actors to help them to focus on certain aspects of a performance not to have to think for instance and not to deploy cognitive load about storytelling if you go to watch improv shows especially long form narrative improv shows you notice that sometimes people are limited in their head because we try to make sense of the plot what s coming after here there is a chat about that sounds lines that sometimes didn t make sense to the ears of improvisers well that s what the text says it s like reading beckett it was intended so i m going to deliver it as if i believed it and is if i understood my relationship to the text the membership to the rest of the cast on stage and the audience and so we use this this to have a chat bots as essentially a sort of implementation or a challenge depending on what perspective you take but it has been quite embraced by the community we ve been touring and performing with wearables and chat bots and another aspect that very quickly was introduced was when i started collaborating this project with corey mathewson he was in edmonton i live in london well there is google meet what else so we i actually would walk on stage with a laptop connected with projector he will be on stage they ll be a live audience and we even did shows with to live audiences in two different theaters creating that connection and using the technologywhich is so frail and cre and basically enabling a new source form of communication that would not be normally allowed in the physically bounce theater space so we combine this idea of communication over borders and now over different languages with trying to immerse ourselves in an environment that recreates the sense of presence and proximity in a virtual way and and you build on and and i do have a brief comment and a question so i m very i pass by and i were we re back channel chatting about you know how like a platform like vr would be very well suited for the kind of immersive experience of the sort of dream like events and of course she and i very quickly got to the problem that was just alluded to have access right and and and i m thinking part of the solution i mean i got my my first vr headset yesterday i haven t i haven t like turned it on yet i need to get through this conference first i m afraid to go down that rabbit hole but but i ve done phone based vr right and i m thinking that might be one way right things like google cardboard so so having that sort of premier vr experience but then also the sort of more vr video experience that becomes more accessible so i just wanted to touch on that as as a possibility for expanding audience now speaking of audience and and theater one of the things i m fascinated by his his twitter bots and interacting with them i see zach whalen a fellow twitter bot scholar and enthusiast and creator here you know we usually interact with them and encounter them and in spaces like twitter and or standalone chat bots and things like that i really love what the what the improv team is doing by bringing them onto the stage because i mean so so here here what i m thinking about is is how experts what are the challenges we have with generative work is that is that is all the all that sort of cognitive wrapping your brain around what it is that someone is experiencing right whether it s narrative right or it becomes a theater of the absurd in which there s these non sequiturs right and and stillwe re trying to wrap our brain around it and these things work well with short bits i think that s why one of the reasons twitter bots are so successful you get this little shot that you can kind of wrap your brain around it but but the challenge so i d love to hear you all speak about some of the challenge of doing that over the course of a performance right so that s that s one of the the tricks how long are people willing to go right i think if they know it s pure bonds they may become a little more impatient in my experience people are willing to to give human creative work longer attention and harder work because they expect that there is a reason and the meaning behind it with bots they re like oh that s an algorithm or whatever right and they may not go as far but but so so i love to hear you all you know share your impressions on that but also the very aspect of personification that we have with bots right personification or or i mean even concepts right even if they re not trying to pass as people a lot of these bar accounts are embodying a concept right and so that is the that that is that the so now here you have actors hearing bought deliver delivering bought created generated lines so so so i d love to hear you both here you all kind of talk about that the personification aspect and also the the attention the conceptual you know how that fits into the sort of long game of your performances i think i would like to start with a note on how quickly technology has evolved in the last i d say five years when we started working with this initially we use so called recurrent neural networks which are pretty good at generating sequences and for fairly similar to be in principles and markov chains which had already been explored even violent cheeringinclude shannon in the s was even a reference to clear channel s work in keith johnson spoken in pro the reference was quite dismissive because the mac of chain was generating essentially sentences that vaguely made sense in isolation but didn t make sense in the rest so where the project started it did require a significant amount of work from the performers to to to basically justify whatever was coming and it was essentially adding to be cognitive load so to negate completely the point i made earlier it was simplifying the cognitive load of person delivering the lines but augmenting the cognitive load of all the team around but of course if we justified it as a sort of educational tool for improvisers how do you improvise with a shoe how to improvise with a random audience member who never did improv before and we devised a whole series of tricks which were fairly well correlated with acting techniques which is to establish connections on an emotional level have underlying super objectives in the same way as danny slutsky actors or guided by by by objectives when they deliver lines but technology evolved so quite soon we switch to using transformers architecture which have essentially they sort of tape but it can be seen as a canvas or as as a notepad of about stores the recent past have a conversation and the neural network keeps referring to that tape over and over when it generates text which means that if you introduce a character if you introduce a location the network will basically refer to it and it will even copy the misspellings it will copy the specificuppercase and lowercase of each word and that already helps a lot in the sense that the even though the chat bot cannot keep a stance it can still refer to the past and reincorporate elements for us and that simplifies little bit but the one thing that really made it work was not to use the top choice of a chatbot it was to basically reintroduce human curation and develop and in facts how we made this from a tool that tried to display agency into a tool use for creativity for human creativity so what happens is that for every context every suggestion given by the performer but the other performer we type it in or we there is a special admission going in and then the child comes with multiple choices and there is a human envelope who selects what fits best so there is this human judgment and human evaluation which probably won t be replaced even though we reach general artificial intelligence because this is something that is very specific to the human experience and has nothing to do with intelligence percent so that human enables essentially to curate the answers in the way that that makes sense and justifies well what s going on the stage and that goes with this footage and further was the idea of of art living in some years with a human creativity and creativity with our technology getting into the creativity so it looks like we have five minutes in the in the interest of them starting to wrap up here and keep on time i have a question for chicago priya which is about choices so and i think this follows up from layers question about how to frame art in some ways and i know you re just beginning this project right it s kind of actively in development so i m wondering i m a reservation and so rhetoricians are really interested in the consciousness of the choices that you have to make while you re making something or building something or saying something so i m wondering what what kinds of choices are you making right now while you build your project and how are they constrained by the resources that you have or how are they improved by the accesses that you have to materials like that you have accessto okay thank you thank you for the question actually i was thinking about the access then leonardo like emphasized about the access problem so initially i was also thinking about converting our additional piping to be on board but then i like it then i realized the challenge because i have to buy that pr setup and actually the basic of a project i had to go to schools and conduct this christian poetry and collect the feedback but this band is changed everything so then i was a little like i was like little happy because this dynamic also mature the backbone is necessary parents of a new school students and starting from the like lower grade to higher so in that way now i have a more chances to share the nature of it to everyone to school students and college students so they can watch it and give them a give their feedback to me but again if i want to introduce i can be i feel that that is little more challenge because not all the students are capable of using the android for which has the future to run the br type of work so then that is the challenge i if i asked the material restrictions um i do not have any material constraints and our limitations because i can access to the maps that are digitized by lucky this project also sponsored important pricing maps so that i got it so earlier so then i started working geo referenced maps of both historical maps and current satellite imagery so that work is done and then after like when the pandemic is little bit down i mean the situation was much better earlier a few months before then i did my field receipts and collected photos and i have large number of photos so to create for donation so somehow i managed to do on these blocks before the band which is much now currently in india so now i can then other all of this offers are also available free whatever the software and using so that now the mainly workis like how to reach the students and college people and other ngo people and that that is actually a challenge in this country tuition but let s go thank you alright well we are coming up on my time so unless anyone has a really quick final question maybe we should start wrapping up here and mark reminded me to continue discussing your work on this court as we go through the day or the end of the day depending on where you are thank you very much to our panelists and thank you scott and sarin for providing this platform for us to old chat feel free to unmute wave your arms around say congratulationspop up a reaction to all our panelists thank you very much everyone that was a really interesting discussion and then they then get to unless you re doing some really amazing work and it was really lovely to see so thank you for sharing it with us absolutely agreealready on to the next one
