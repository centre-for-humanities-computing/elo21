the biggest collection of brazilian historycourse i want to tell everything but the question is when is the appropriate time to release all the information only a handful of artifacts the million items that were housed in the museum survive this color so disaster to give you a sense of perspective the collection of the british museum holds million items ella bottom me of the brazilian memoryimage of a nation it s lens its lens and its culture the immense encyclopedic collection included priceless archives of pre columbian indo american cultures the oldest human remains ever found in brazil and audio recording of indigenous languages may have many of them are nolonger spoken also million butterflies and other entrepreneurs years old fossil human remains thousands of indigenous ceramics and a fresco from pompeyin survived the fire new problem indigo travel from space to brazilian soil of the here and rests still of the ground for several thousand years and irregular math

first when he first spotted it the year was given the slow local movement of people and commerce the news of finding of the findings spread quickly in governor do agreements management says arrange for it to be transported to salvador however the metal right excessive weight made transportation difficult the card it was on last its control and the method right phil and dry stream bed just meter away from the sport it was originally find the method i did not travel with the people the people started to visit then they go there are society published drawing in its periodical and the first reproduction of the metal rock started to orbit the visual sphere you can buy a copy in pounds the year was year later it was lifted and rolled to the national museum and stopped right by its doors first from pies passed by the personnel and the metal turnstiles it was resting on the national brazilian pedestal for years always first to view the first image to take then the fire happened no major damage stared first through behind the metal turnstiles all covered with ashes from burnt neighboring objects images were uploaded and downloaded links were shared post were posted pictures transmitted up to a deer uptoward a space and fell down to brazilian earth what are the means which is seeds after the ashes in the images vested i clicked on the link and entered the museum again they re there they re not no no to the right or to the left i pass the two blurred faces on personnel and glided through the metal turnstiles on my way to the staircase i dragged my cursor around and above been diego smearing glitches with depressions and cylinder shaped holes forming a god digital irregularmass of image matter one would hope that contemporary technology would offer its most treasured artifacts a better chance of survival than the library of alexandria it feels almost unimaginable that so many valuable objects were simply white of the earth of the face of the earth without living a digital trace and the age of algorithmic reproduction when automatic backup is a default standard too often we need to find the right for the right to be forgotten but the economy of remembering everything is still entangled with the geography of the right to be remembered but you see this storage space was licking for a while now over of the national collection was simply lost because there was not enough water in the fire hydrant to extinguish the blaze an error a break within the order and world for some times now the pressure is in the fire hydrants was too low but the high pressure of real estate industry developers didn t stop pumping bringing the system to the brink of collapse this is a dry season for fire hydrants and water pumps and local reservoir and natural water shades for some times now bodies of water are slowly dehydrating under official priorities for modern water dry became a condition this was an old building with old an old with building with all sorts of all lives and no no liquidityliquid assets the city was busy building a brand new museum of tomorrow it was a question of liquidity fire was the methoda fragmented and eclectic digital collection survive from the ruins the images available on wiki wikimedia commons all taken by small interest group and visitors who captured highlights from the collection that are now stored on their personal devices or cloud services or shared via social media their images that can report are too much other data they have been slowly aggregated other images they saw location they checked in at a personal library organized by geolocation or facial recognition i think you know social network and other datapoints are having the confidence they are partial anecdotal broken but also very much

ashes ashes we all fall down thank you for free for that beautiful performance mode for people to react to express their appreciation next up on our on our bill we have kristen sy lee and alfred s fox with perfect movement engineering for better everyday zooming please take it away welcome welcome and thank you so much for joining us or should we think your bosses for making this mandatory we wouldn t be here without them so let s give them a short round of applause so who are we i m kristin ass wiley and i offered as fox and we are cc oh is that cheap corporeal officials at good movement inc we re here to present our latest invention perfect movement engineering for better every day zooming a little bit aboutus we are amazing and we are insightful and usually we re on a roll your bosses payroll no seriously folks we love this this is our bread and butter with cheese and placed on a hot grill we are the grilled cheese of this zoo testing brave new world and happy to serve our glee insights to zoomers across the globe we do this for upwards of thousand dollars now that s a lot that s a day we re generously donating our time to yellow we re here to help you maximize your performances to level up or zuma so before we begin we need to get a little disclaimer out of the way so take a moment to read it there s nothing unusual here just your typical terms and conditions it continues so take a moment to scan it make sure everything is in order okay here s the last bit go ahead and finish reading okay great so if you find our terms and conditions to be disagreeable we invite you to leave the zoom call now hit the road jack and if you stay you are legally bound to our terms and conditions as being president this presentation confirms yourconsent okay so everyone here can sense wonderful okay so here s an overview of our extensive qualitative and quantitative research based on observing our willing zoom clientele and collecting their data so after extensive review and analysis of our texts or test subjects data points we found a positive correlation between better zoom performances and better workplace promotions and overall quality of life and our expert data team has assured us thatthis research might not be perfect but it s definitely good so let s take a closer look at one of the data visualization a deep dive this is a rare behind the scenes look at where the magic happens if you look at the upper right quadrant you can easily see that our network data points establish a clear causal relationship between better zooming and better shoe money we re all about the holistic human here at better movement ink so the first round based on this extensive research we have identified three key realms of perfect movement based training so the first round the holistic situation of the entire body while teleconferencing the second one is the micro movements of the face including the man the third is the realm of hand gestures which we know that you academics are particularly fond of okay let s get into it so we re going to need you are to turn on your cameras judy would you mind turning your camera on mark would you mind also your

on point now what you ve all been waiting for we re going to demo three perfect movements perfect movement number one the attempt nod so you re nodding thoughtfully you re conveying attentiveness and now let s break down these specific features that continuous nodding at an even tempo not too fast notjust you re gonna want to slay me raise your eyebrows not too much you don t want to seem surprised but wow that was a really good idea and you really taken it in widened those eyes but not too much lean in but not too far into slightly just to show meaning just slightly just to show i m really contemplating that while you re doing this be careful to manage the micro movements and your eyebrows and your cheekbones people will notice what s happening across your entire face so once you ve mastered the basics of this gesture we have some optional advanced add on features for instance chin on hand you might lean forward hmm and then keep nodding because how you re really thinking or the hush your cell phone up jessica to show you re really listening so perfect movement number two the empathetic furrow you re concerned but you re showing empathy now let s break down the specific features so the furrowed brow the furrowed eyebrows soft eyes but not too soft you don t want to look like you re asleep slightly flared nostrils to really show how much you re empathizing and a frown an empathetic from though not a clown fromperfect movement number three the million miles smile you re leaving the meeting you re giving your best outros smile and wave you re conveying genuine warmth and leaving them all with a winning million mile smile now let s break down the specific features the term make sure to choose good so that big movie star smile make sure to scrunch your eyes and lift your cheekbones to convey genuine warm the speed and rhythm of the wave not too fast not slow just right just right so the hands also need to be in a correct distance from the camera so not too far oh hello or not too close just right so now freeze once you ve done this for a couple of moments you ve gotten in your smile on your way you ve made sure everyone has seen it while you re trying to find the button to leave the call you re going to pause your wave and just freeze while you find the clothes buttons you make sure to leave them with the best image okay great so now you re all going to get together and breakout rooms to practice in small groups you ll coach and support each other to maximize your effective performance for each perfect movement once you ve helped each other level up and you ve all reached optimal levels for one of the three movements you will take a screenshot so you should in effect have three screenshots within five minutes one document in each of the three perfect movements you re going to want to designate one person within your small group to take each screenshot and upload it to a folder that weare posting in the chat now so make sure that you click

bring this this conference to an almost close remember there are panels afterthis so without further ado let me introduce the awards now that yellow awards a few things that the community should know they re all supported through donations for the award so these did not come from membership dues they every year we select member of the board that will act as awards convener this is a person that does not have any conflict of interest in terms of being eligible for an award that given year that awards convener along with the board selects an external committee from the community to be the jury for the award and the convener then works independently with the jury to you know we send out a call but then the convener works independentlywith a jury to go through the process of selecting and awarding the yellow awards the three yellow awards that we have come with prize as well as a little plaque and board members who are eligible the first year we were not eligible but then became eligible for awards as we externalize the process because of the bylaws boardmembers cannot receive any kind of funding you know we cannot accept funding so whenever if any board member ever wins the award that is assigned to usually a fellow fellow that helps develop projects with the board member and so these things are donated again without further ado honor that i will introduce on an offer who served as our awards convener and who s going to introduce the jury and and the awardees so i m all yours thank you leo let me share my screen so i can show you what it s going on with with the

do you all probably know who s gonna be over there with the maverick and soon and i m going to pass to scott red bird and caitlin fisher who tell a bit more about the origins of the category and about behind the scenes so to speak i m caitlin sure are you there scott i m here okay it s a bit anticlimactic now screen sharing for a minute or or not maybe you could start anyway yeah so go ahead yeah i ll start um so last year about this time at elo when we were at the week for david lauren baker we a number of us had a discussion around the importance of recognizing the artists and scholars and amazing people as part of the halo community who who sometimes are not the people most likely to be winning the other awards because they re on a crazy brilliant genius path all their own and so out of that discussion came came the idea for a maverick award you want to take it over from there scott for bit sure yeah and as as caitlyn said we were gathered at awake for for damon learn baker who was who was somebody who kind ofworked outside of the the guidelines and was very difficult person to categorize and and while we were talking at that event talent suggested that there should be a maverick award an award for for someone who took an unconventional path yeah who really sort of colored outside of the lines and of course damon is part of this prize there s a tribute to damon which is a bottle of sondra man damon s favorite liquor and the prize will be in a bottle of the center man but as we as we make this award for the first time we re thinking of talent who i think is a maverickto which we can provide future aspirations for for everyone in the electronic literature community those of you who know talent know that he was a skateboarder in a punk rocker and a chef a sous chef and a chef at one of the a great restaurant in san francisco before he became a web designer and started a perceptive con a web design company insan francisco and while he was he was a web designer and independent creator he created a web journal called beehive that was in the s and early s one of the most important venues and adventurous venues for the publication of electronic literature and then those of you who know his work of course know lexi to perplex sia which is one of the most canonical works of electronic literature but you also know that you know talent who came out of a an arts background i worked a bit at cal arts and was was friends with kathy actor and certainlyinfluenced by and developed works in a variety of media throughout his career and continues to not trying to talk in the in the past tense about talent but he he worked in film he worked in visual arts he s he s worked in electronic literature in many different varieties he s worked he worked on the ll board to always provide the yellow board with an alternative perspective robert coover i remember when he was talking about what he was trying to do or why he got into electronic literature to begin with and started teaching it was he said that he always wanted to encourage writers to work against the grain of the media in which they wereoperating and talent is someone who has always worked against the brain and always challenged the media he did things like start the under academy college an alternative university that did not a here to to the normal rules for instance that you you would pay tuition or be graded but instead you would have kind of imaginary university realized where you would all create together so i m very happy to announce the first winner of the maverick award and to read the designation which will be an award given in the future as well by the yellow and of course it ll be donation supported i encourage you all to donate i will after this event so the maverick is to be awarded annually to an independent spirit a writer artist researcher programmer designer performer or hybrid creator who does not adhere to a conventional path but creates their own and in so doing makes a singular contribution to the field of electronic literature and the winner of course is talent well i just wanted to just on behalf of my brother he lives at maverick life and he did and he does and he did from when he was a little kid you can imagine growing up in a house with him being a little kid andhim and a neighbor starting a film company at like years old and they started a theater in the neighbor s house concession stand amazing movies you know stop action films all this stuff and it just continued on from there and for for me to be able to accept this on his behalf you have to understand that he was an inspiration for me to go into art education as well i know he would have loved to have been here to accept it sorry it won t just serve as an encouragement warm but it will serve as an acknowledgement of years of hard work dedication of perseverance that all that to finally be recognized for it so i want to thank elo for honoring him in this way and thank you for understanding and encouraging his maverick way so thank you all right love love you the mamet s love you love you dennis and love talent so talent will be watching this this video momentarily and we hope that he has many years of creation ahead of him but i think this moment of recognizing that electronic literature isn t just about those of us who who choose a conventional path but those of us who who do things that no one would expect that s how our field came about and telling them what i think is the person who personifies that most so thank you to the yellow for deciding to give this award and thank you to talent and also our hearts go out right now to the moment family talent is is going to is going through some difficult times right now but he s he s going to survive and his life s work is treasured and valued by all of us so thanks so much thank you so much and i must add that talent is a great colleague amazing colleague i was lucky enough to teach at winona state university in creative visual media with devin heckman and time management and our conversation we rejust fascinating so sending all my love and healing energies to tell them to both methods actually um so i think we don t have much time left and i was thoroughly stressed through this ceremony for many reasons but i would like to add some gratitude and huge things first of all i m immensely grateful to all the jury s members whose work i so much appreciate and whose contributions in also in terms of comments and opinions they wanted to share with us about the process and will still end the discussion that ihope will contribute to how this process will what it will look like in the nearest future and special things go to holly slocum for her enthusiasts skills and
