as long as like the laws standards that s the way they are but they re sort of examples like that right of like you know making the internet a public utility you know i think it s it s things that we understand are technically possible do we have like the sort of like social and political will to to achieve them it s so true and that s part of the part of the failure of our you know university structures were much stronger in the early in the s so much innovation have a free internet exchange and email early emails that book was driven by universities as beingyou know centers that would make this available and and public and and all that changed you know really changed dramatically when it started to become profitable of course and the lack of strong institutions globally to do this is something that i think you know we have to it s not an easy solution that we have to get institutions these institutions to make it a public commitment and of course the universities are less and less public in their philosophy and you re writing can be towns but it really needs big infrastructure as well one is countering the who owns the why is the comcast so forth here states that charge ridiculous fees and control this and it s also who s who s controlling these platforms that were on in other ways like we just started mentioned zoo but it s you know practically we need them pretty big institutional voice to say no we ll do something else with this they re going to come out the libraries and universities governments not that the us but other governments could and one thing i was wondering is that is there a way that we can look at these i m not gonna say pre web i m going to say non web spaces as non historical but mainly a reframing and reconsidering of net discourse in which we can go and because there are plenty of non web space is i think what happens i think we limit ourselvesso much to you know there s the web is the internet and then as a subset face you know social media is the internet and i think what happens is that we ve you know we ve gotten down to the point where there s this idea that somehow that there areplaces in which we can speak which is the internet or we can go into and the thing is is down in the guts of the beast there are all of these spaces that still exist but the thing is is that they re still vibrant they re still active and they re nothistorical but it s the fact that they have existed ever since there you know or you know the other thing is is dare i say the poor net you know they i mean just imagine that how are these spaces that are not the not the traditional internet spacescan be used for for all the things we re talking about that are not the web or social media yeah i think i mean yeah there s sort of two aspects to that right there s one of like do these like spaces still sort of like actually technically technologically function right and in many cases they still do they didn t there s a question of like the social aspect of it right like is there a critical mass people using them to do the things that you know you would do on facebook or twitter or or other spaces yeah on the web right so that s and we re talking about the intersection between the sort of social side of it in the technological side but i mean one i think they do but i think the idea is the matter of that how do we build a context institutionally and pedagogically you know to be able to get our institutions our students to understand these spaces are viable yeah yeah i think i mean but it also speaks to the fact that you know a lot of these like these protocols still still function speaks to the robustness of them which is something that s not the case and things that have been developed today right whichis just sort of like a stack of house of cards in many cases right it s like you know how much longer islike you know the ability to keep using sam or the ability to keep using these learning management platforms necessitates us to continue like the upgrade path right where as there s like these robust protocols that s still that s still exists becausethey were sort of simple and designed to work for a long time so i mean that s just another sort of point in their in their favor but everything in terms of like economics and socially is point us in the direction of these digitally precarious corporate eyes platforms maybe we have time for one more question or two questions nope um i guess then we can start preparing for the next session which is the the keynote which will begin in about minutes is that right yes yes and it will be in the webinar yeah yeah so let s link in the program and i d like to say if any way thank you everyone for also for for this panel for the key to time if you want more information on that please contact me
