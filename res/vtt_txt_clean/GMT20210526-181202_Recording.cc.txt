york burlingtonbergen december hello thank you tina scott for that fantastic piecethat was titled feminist manifesto and times of coronavirus i should have read the title at the beginning next up we have used to tie here from shanghai you see are you ready hello everyone welcome to speak pen you ve probably wandered around the internet and came across this drawing tool i m you joe and today i m here to guide you through your first creation in the following tutorials i will explore some of the main components contributed to the drawing tool let s get started writing has always been a huge part of my life i write about anything they re not necessarily good but it s a ritual that i dohave written scripts lurks homes fictions and nonfiction means i wrote about a movies that i saw keep one that the weather and random words like this for me grant writing is a way to de stress i remember the first time that i started writing was actually an incident i had just turned nine or and my parents took me and my best friend camping to celebrate my birthday we re not really that outdoorsy type or adventurous type so that was very exciting for me just outside our campsite there was a stream with lots of rocks on it and of course as kids yeah my friend had to go jump on the rocks there i wasexcited to go on my first adventure for the rocks was too slippery and my shoes was wrong so i fell into the water i remember crying so hard and feeling so embarrassed that our whole family had to pack up and go home to this day my friends so made phone with me remembering that afternoon i can still feel the disappointment in the car ride home remember feeling embarrassed remorseful sad so when i got home i started writing my dad had kept all my journals from when i was a kid there in his storein a studies couple of years ago i started looking at those journals and realized that i used to draw pictures to replace some of the words that i that i didn t know how to write that was very interesting to me i started theorizing about those writings i did back when i was a kid and i even tried to create those texts but they just like to play for this the pureness and then i eunice what a shame how when you grow up you become so preoccupied with making sense of everything my favorite book was blitz by maggie nelson blue bloods what s a gift from a friend this was also her favorite book i remember the first time i picked it up my friend rubio was playing van halen guitar and after a couple pages i felt a kind of closeness to maggie to be and even to eddie van halendays later i ve decided to translate book into chinese i ve asked ruby would be a reason for someone to like the color blue sure appliedblues the easiest color to match it s like black she said it s an absence of color but a color it s like being expressive while not appear to be expressivedown there inside seen gun show fortunately song portion she signs me yes sir so i m sure sure that safe enjoy each fora color blue emerged from the coziness of an atom spirit created when two people are connected emotionally and intellectually and are physically this was the sentence i wrote on the first page of the notebook where i translated now since bullets but there are words that cannot be expressed with different languages there are words that are not meant to be translated there are wordsthat are not meant to be translated there are words that are not meant to be translated from that i have been using for the past six years was that its maximum capacity i ve struggled for the last couple months and finally last week i had to do a hard reset to wipe it storage i had a lot of trouble transferring all the data to the cloud around to another device to be perfectly honest i haven t been writing for a while now i worked at a small company from nine to seven a lot of my time and my energy got consumed empty soda cans and dirty laundry started to pile up in my room like the image of a stereotypical programmer i hunched over the desk thinking about the time that i fell into the stream more as you on this tool the slower it becomes i think it is also exhausted it probably wants to go back where you just saw was a tutorial for speak pen and i encourage you to try it out thank you so much for watching feel free to leave some comments and also improvements to the tools i ll see you in my channel next time thank you so much easier for that beautiful piece on mark mark simon clapping i think from everybody that s such a wonderful instrument that text one sprint and beautiful performance on it except we have eric sepa with women to a costume eric are you awesome a nice one back at the bottom fairly bad insincere protective simply the illusion flashes and reels are laughter impertinence was fine and spiteful blacks pq train the most i body whose synergy you cursed until a split and warning and unreality so bleak and fade then which here perpetuate recognize nothing in less than real in theory center really only happened center split rummaging through the bandmeant a lot each and each of her hymns electric and song is the manuscript which both in various a few verses that were made in memory of your porcelain bone pain something up in the company remit can be done silicone spatula through directly mixture spooks and romances the caramel comedy they don t tell me how you feel about to god the most important single point you now oh the xerox machine go to the moment live into boston each and working on it into things like a nice franchise that the printers had to be strung out likewise along the way so they want to be mistaken online during the diving board it s your uncle on the camera you can gain their their picture the diner it was at the end of the trees that concert the cpe redeemable coming on to like excuse me what s the typical the break which reminded everyone not of justice but events which are the poet s foreshadowing for an unexpected irreversible and loomis chart they spoke to each other what shall we take from this what about the bush what does it matter eaglesspot and assurance paper was said to become overinflated that it s calculus the disinherited for spirals she can be sound desolation as the satisfaction of channels and backgrounds as the vapor me runs in miniature which was cultivated and look justlike a diminutive daughter in the manger with sydney patch the candidate bundling drugs or they had some name so the type of sparkling water which was supposed to do something or neutralize effects that the plansdid anything for how easily don t get when put into term that number is given the right materials for the right equations the time for movement which through an innovation of one of the druids could now be reckoned on one of the agricultural grids was estimated on what he called the comedy type in later humor you ll note as a color printer ink can be accumulated in morethan one way this was not possible to do in the tapping later which constitutes maker to abandon the product and engage in the botanical analysis of herbal threads the classification of the lucknow tendencies of the trip this criminal the idea that you could form a consistent stands by leaping off rocks was almost universally disputed yet for the author of the tablet later it was clear that the only evidence of criminality was an active inversion it was clear that this was not the data undermining most of the critiques that repetitive that is it was not through eventful analysis but the reproduction of event which for all the many parameters to keep constant would consistently create randomvariations the hunch of the performance completely in the solvent the preservation of pigments and liquid combination with not reverse but the same club then each defense and violence in the idea of the desolation of the now entirely obscured figurewas the case of continuity the manicure of simmering spiral inflation syndrome and the comedy tabulate a record in the most wretched of terms reprimanded for a more consistent result thank you that was beautiful it was it was a good tour of a cosmic prismatic engine thank you clapping next on our on our list is jason nelson with secret lives of a lockdown objects but unfortunately i think those secret lives may remain secret because i don t think he s here with us jason are you here under under an assumed name different name i don t think so soi m just hoping that you ll suddenly appear but i don t think so so next up we will have a dar who just momentarily appeared darpa trauma and company from st petersburg russia with freedom is freedom is freedom is freedom this performances are authored by daria with participants who are students of the laboratory of media poetry went to one instructors berg and so i read their names i practice reading and they probably won t be too bad the other participants are all sasha and need a christian scalia serial killer and a totally pamela master copy over leon stroke of the on a picnic over catarina reviewover in an associate trust and the perform participants in this performance also include you member of the audience or fellow performer in this zoom event if you would like to participate daria will explain how this will work and we ll have a concludingportion of this piece in tomorrow s performance session so daria and thank you america for introduction i m excited to be here and so i m really going to invite all of you to take part in performance right after this meeting well actually i m sure you re tired of sitting in front of the screen and want to take a walk and it will be the performance section first combined for the trees and communication that the telegraph cap give me seconds i will share dreams means to telegram chat with you this is chad yeah okay so now i m enjoying it and so as i mentioned all the laboratory of media boys they also they are in the performance and i also call this some of you know take back to thomas is called freedom is freedom freedom is freedom very short conceptual poem by service after several of the classes he reflected on freedom to to and when me and students came up with the theme of the performance we discussed this creation old the being a young artist in contemporary rush internationally can take in jail time even for a simple report or social medium so now we as artists mirror our intentions against the degree of inner freedom so it was our officers deflection on the on the feel of the performance i m looking forward to to reflections and now let me say a few words about how to go how do you happen to be the moderator it s actually right in the chat and predetermine what media should be used to answer theold tasks so we will remind you of inception from conceptual art in fact i was actually in a sense of the follower it was the creative freedom and those given condition so we will have various tasks and you will have direct major and so you have very determined condition of i ma go over this the format is to understand the mechanics of the multimedia like chad really so tools for the nation like location noises voice messages photos and social media file girl part of the leverage full fledged and re capture the participants in communication so the loss of their us are being formed rapidly right here now before our eyes and our fingers so my best idea is to research this process process and i invite you to search for your own logos of artistic communication in chat ties into the platform at the greatest to do and please let me say a few words about performance together andrew i will turn on my creativity demonstration for now you have the pedigree chart i m sotired of start right after the finish of this meeting and it will last about minutes yes but they can bog as i mentioned before please turn chat so this performance about the dog for a walk so don t forget to charge your phone right now please and listen to me and i will ask you to be the default and have a son next that s when most of you will answer and if i see that nobody is not typing so if you don t want to answer so feel free just be quiet so in brackets up to my best career you will see which means i will ask you to write should be like ask you answer by voice message or by photo if i write any soul you re free to do any media and the also yes i would be grateful to you if you go right on their response to my performance so thank you for your attention i hope that i will see some this by you re in the telegram performance job you re in the telegram performance job yes unfortunately i see the question charter so no you should have tesla car but it s very easy just your phone number and the phone has a reputation for example it looks like to with with telegram that you can use something like google voice or another like sort of temporary number to create an account so it wouldn tnecessarily have to be your phone number there are some other options if you re if you d like to receive that are reluctant to to use the app with your own number great i had one other question for you tommy which is if if people are not available right now if they re available say a little later could they join the chat and how the instructions and do it a little bit later between today and tomorrow is that something that is possible no it s just you know at that time everyone this resistance being here and now and corresponding with each other okay great we re just checking just to see if that would
