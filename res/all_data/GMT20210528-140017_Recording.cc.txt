digital novel in animate ellis and here is the model that i had applied like i had joined two trees and to to to analyze and to present the data that was in animate l is like an electronic literature cs is okay moving towards the introduction of this present study digital technology actually offers innovative activities that lead its users to one human movement which helps them to find new ways of getting knowledge and if we look at digital literature it comes up after remarkable changes in digital technology and electronic literature is also one of them and it is entirely different from literature and the if we look at the definition of electronic dictionary says that it is something that is made digitally andand intended to be observed digitally so yeah it is different and in this in this section i ll be explaining the basic difference between these two a piece of electronic literature is completely different from print one because it amalgamated a number of digital elements like sounds like portable images interactivity user user and the viewers will be interactive there and it just amalgamate all these features together with a written text and also it makes it more flexible nonlinear and more intricate which presents the viewers choices up being integrated the environment upgrading has been slightly different nowadays because of this pandemic and this immersive literacy and depiction via you via visual expression so this breaks down the traditional cycle of reading literature piece yeah these are the rhetorical questions i was just asking to myself as well and i wanted you to like discuss them as the question of a basic question was what is the need and the purpose of literature like for me it is for the for the sake of enjoymentand like entertainment and to get some knowledge as well but yeah the second question is why does the teacher always enjoy the status of being transformed and modify the third one is are these modifications from like from order to print to do electronic literature are these modification really advantageous or not another important question is does play reading still exists or not if we are reading it we are really electronic literature does this player ratings still exist or not this will be answered like industry but yeah okay if we are moving towards the significance of this research now the the findings of this study we don t do the benefit of the society like more specifically pakistani settings that the interactive multimodal fiction is new emerging literature so it is crucial for the digital natives well i think we pakistanis are still digital consumers but yeah you can call us digital natives as is crucial for the digital natives to understand what are the new modes that are being used in the construction of electronically teacher okay here are the pew research questions that will be answered in the is there any possibility to understand the story red riding hood that electronic version as the readers understand that even version of red riding hood in the past the second one is bit of the semantic elements of chiggers involved in the construction of the both versions of red riding hood like the pink and the electronic version and the third one is are the different modes there that are presented in the story that riding hood electronic version conveying the meaning clearly or not yeah okay moving towards the framework that i had applied to present the data and to analyze the data from both print version and the electronic version of red riding hood so since electronic literature involves we will show we will semiotic analysis called multimodal analysis that is presented by cast and men live in then and then analysis is attached with the framework so i had just categorized different modes and features like texture and non texture and in those features i had further categorize these moves like narrative style didn t text uses interactivity vehicles and music and songs and at the end these all modes will be discussed collectively in the collective finding textual and non textual modes okay here is the literature review the related literature that i have i had found a lot of a lot of books on multi modality and on like intermediate ality also and on like electronic literature but unfortunately i have not found anybody that hasbeen done in pakistan is setting so yeah it would be the very first work that is done in pakistani setting okay if we are moving towards the presentation and data analysis of textual and non sexual features the first one is narrative style in red riding hood both versions the piece of electronic literature beers are more realistic approach by presenting via live settings behaviors and events that that i like said as jumping off point for the duration of the story that that like said as a jumping off point for the duration of the story also the instructions were mentioned in the very beginning that the users and the viewers are allowed to narrate the story to their own understandable at so the genetic and the concept of narratives and edit ology is becoming different while we are talking about electronic literature the written text in red riding hood well the electronic version of red riding hood is described and expand to be based on non textual modes yet comprehending the master narrative and underlying notion behind the construction of this whole there has been brothers a print version of red riding hood little red riding hood is entirely revolving around mono modern text that is the reason that so the linearity makes it possible in the modern modern version of literature to lead towards towards a few indignities confusions and can be considered differently than the authors intended meaning so on the other hand it is left on the readers and like electronic literature is left on the readers and to comprehend it on their own and if we are giving some more power to the reader enhance it will enhance their own understand ability of the ofthe thing they are viewing okay i have i have just extracted up uv wells from the electronic version of red riding hood here are the few weevils and i have analyzed them via looking there the color combination and the expressions the background these are all here so yeah it made more easy to the to the to the viewer and the user to comprehend it more clearly than that of the modern modern text okay uses interactivity in the red riding hood okay in the in the print version you will not be getting any type of users interactivity often the be all and end all of reaching but here in that electronic literature you will be the user or the viewerwill be getting this opportunity to select and choose the different options to move and the story further so yeah uses interactivity is is is like the the important thing that is used in the electronic literature and cherished and like is flourished okay these are the findings are and conclusion of the study the present study seeks to explore the difference between mono model and multimodal children s literature by focusing on that in red riding hood and the paper also questions the denominationin literature as something that is needed only and i ve used that multimodal aspects that are different modes that i had told in the very beginning they should be included in the in the definition of literature and they should be better integratedinto the definition okay the analysis of this study underscores the importance of electronic literature in this digital age specifically in pakistan because we are just taking baby steps here and like i just know about electronic literature one and a half year back andi don t know where we are in the past the present study has been completed in pakistan where the devious s in this specific field or not commonly available yeah this would be this will be good for the future researchers to look at electronic literature yeah thank you thank you so much and welcome i don t know if you saw the chat but as low florists wrote in the chat welcome you found a community for electronic literature here anyway so we re really happy that you found the conference and that you re participating i wonder if we should start with some questions for you chris and then and then after judith talk we could have some questions for judith and then maybe combine the two but i would just like to invite anyone who has questions to eat for right away yes if i if i may i just wanted to say you know i remember and and like it s it s so interesting to see your presentation and it s always like it s always important of course for us to define our terms and and and the final electronic literatureand all these things and and one of the things like it s always great to we have to hear this over and over to see what we re pushing against right that and and it s great to see the evolution of that like years ago were really the fighting against the page in some ways and and i know that you were touching on someof these things because it shows the weight of the the the weather in a different panel we have been calling that the hedgehog monuc control that the page exerts over us right like like literature and the page and writing and unit modality instead ofmulti modality right like i could totally see right multi modality and as in done fair crash and so like like we re pushing against all that in our normal environments unless you re in bergen or right like when a digital culture program where wherepeople get it right even myself i m in north carolina in appalachian state university in a department that that i need to define electronic literature for all the time they like they have no idea and so this is this is one of the important things about the yellow where we kind of come together and here s people that that understand right we we got it and so and so that s really great and i just wanted to applaud your paper and welcome to our community and and know that you know we re here we re here to help you build right and and we want to hear so much from you so so just sorry it was more than a welcoming than a question but but yes welcome thank you very much and trust me you will be getting more information and more papers in the next yellow conference inshallah we are thirsty for it right we we want to hear definitely did you say you re just starting a phd now eat crow yep i was studying my phd and what will the topic be i will be focusing on a part of the technology multi modality because of course analysis of an interactive fiction and i will be joining different electronic mutated pcs and i ll be analyzing them and like in the in the pakistani setting that wouldthing for me and yeah thank you very much for the kind of a few point to just go this i would like to note however that anytime we talk about a work of literature the first thing that should come out is the author s name can you tell us why the name of the author which i do happen to know but why don t you tell us and why you chose her where your topic why i chose this topic i want to know that i want you totell us the name of the author of the work okay i am not know the writer of the little red riding hood okay leishman leishman yeah because that is the most core part of literature from the point of view i will say over writer not necessarily everybody s going to do yeah why did you choose that particular work which is a beautiful work so um because here people do you know about little red riding hood the print version the link brothers had done this but they do not know about red riding hood that is an electronicversion also so for the very first time my professor asked me to just just experienced this and yeah i got this like very much interesting and after that i had just chosen this thatthat other that other sees interacting with with mcs but yeah this was the very first word that i had experience so i got this but so one question i have is because i m that particular donna leachman red riding hood doesn t have very many words does it it s it s a while since i ve read it but it s a very visual piece isn t it so does that make it even harder to analyze us literature did you find yeah it was hard but i had applied acuity that is multimodal analysis and here the gas and melvin has given this model so yeah i adapted that model and then i put that model and then i analyze those different modes categorically then i compile thosemodes and then that result comes in yes there s some there s some suggestions for you here in the in the chat as well alex you don t have a microphone all right alex has a question i wonder if it would also be useful to also consider our old version so like folk tale versions of red riding hood and the analysis did you draw upon other red riding hood versions yeah i bought them but i just want you to focus on these two in this paper yes for short paper you ve got to focus of course hmm and then you mentioned that there s not a lot of electronic literature in pakistan yet and i was wondering because i ve read a little bit about indian electronic literature and about how like sms india in india has more india india has done a lot of work in electronic literature and digital technology they are just incredible people but we obviously we are just trying to like cope with the situation and yeah i really trying to this but i was wondering whether if you sort of look more broadly at it because i did notice the one of the indian overviews that was talking about sms novels and those kind of more social media storytelling as maybe being as visible in an indian a lot andguess we ve seen similar things in other in other parts of the world as well so i was wondering if you are there any sort of social media storytelling or literary activities that you think one could think of as electronic literature you think but as as a literature student i had not get anything about electronic literature in my graduation and no one even asked me to do that and no one even like not even my professor had like asked me not even the suggested us because we didn t know aboutit and one and a half year back when i was in my mtl i got this idea that yeah there is an electronic musician it s um i think several of us have been in that position where we re like discovered probably we ve all been in that position where we discovered electronic literature like wow and then you try to convince the people that you re working with it orat the department that this is a good an interesting thing so we re really happy to have you here are you able to share your screen i will no thank you it s so exciting to be a pioneer i m so excited for you right what a position to be in i think we re probably envious right a whole new sort of territory to enter and to i m saying pioneer even though it s a colonial term because that s a little that s a little segue here so my paper is called distributed memories comfy serve gamers forum and the halcyon days of the adventure game toolkit otherwise known on this panel is now for something completely different see why am i not advancing my screen here there we go so my paper starts with a family memory on this is the strong museum of play in rochester and i took my kids there as teenagers that my son was really mad he said mom why don t you take me here when i was a kid right what a wonderland and i my strongest memory of it though was we were in the pinball room which is just incredible lights and sound and every pinball machine you can play for free and he wandered away from it and he found a table where there was an ancient oregon trail playing and he sat down at that table and he wouldn t leave so he spent most of his time at the strong museum for play playing oregon trail which is a game he played as a kid and didn t love very much and he played it at school and he played it at home and initially i was really annoyed with him because it s expensive it s an expensive miss and he sat there playinga game he could have played at home but i m glad i didn t really stop him because he was in a flow state and i recognized later and then sort of re recognized as i was writing this paper that he was immersed but he wasn t just immersed in this game and this game is incredibly multimodal right oregon trail has been remade in a variety of ways and it s aboard game and a card game andit s a it s a really well traveled territory the oregon trail but he was not he didn t like the game as a kid that much so what was he doing in his flow state playing this game in the museum he was returning to a game world but not just the game world of the game he was returning to his life world to who had been when he had played this game he was having an experience of the story and that reminded me thinking about that sort of anecdote in my life of this paper which is a very influential paper for me it was a study that was done over several years and i don t think they they didn t publish collectively about it i think they published individually about it this really amazing dream team of people who looked at the problem of preserving virtual worlds and on the right you see a list of the games the specific games that they looked at and one of the chapters in that white paper is the virtual worlds that died during their project which really spoke to me and they meant it kind of literally the disappearance well let me show you the next slide and then i ll say what was disappearing because how they defined virtual worlds as they looked at these games and the communities around the games is that they had to analyze game worlds as artifacts meaning thesoftware and hardware needed to play them and then worlds is commodities because in many cases these were games that had to be purchased or there were fees to access and then also as communities the people in and around the interaction with those and so the issues of preserving and archiving and curating these worlds required three really different sort of tracks of effort so the socio technical in and around the artifacts themselves and the platform is in the hardware the legal in and aroundgames is commodities when we have laws which protect software from copying which made it actually illegal in some sense to to archive them in a playable state and then the communities which require ethnographic as well as other sorts of efforts to preserve them which is complicated and difficult so when any of these aspects are gone to recreate the world means doing forensic work as people are using thatterm now that s a little dark for me i like the metaphor of archaeology in the idea that restorative work can be done to get to get these worlds back at least if not back so that you can enter them fully back that you can visit them the way you visitsomething that s curated and what i m specifically interested in in this regard is particulargestalt trying to find the word for it more than a community kind of a early s gamers gestalt that occurred through the bbs platform compu serve so the pre internet era is something that is personally interesting to some of the people in the room as well a fascinating period a period in which the world was discovering electronic literature in a variety of ways hypertext based forums as well as parcel basedtext based games which saw himself more as game than literature but which i consider also literatureand copy serve was an interesting place for many reasons its contribution to the internet are often overlooked because in large part it disappeared so compu serve was bought by america online in and it its heyday compu serves heyday was in the bbs dial up era so when it when it went away it turns out that it archived almost nothing of itself it s truly a lost world but the loss is more than just the loss of the digital artifacts it s also the loss of community and it s really an under explored community so i have an interest in pursuing some archaeological or restorative work where it comes to the life world of coffee serve and specifically gamers forum which was a community within the community of companies are so if you re not old enough to remember the bulletin the pre internet of bulletin board era it was expensive you had to pay for your phone call to dial up and then you generally had to pay for a service so there was what you might call socio technical drift meaning that people use products differently than they were intended clearly compu serve wanted to makeas much money as possible and users wanted to spend as little money as possible and so another sort of software developed a taps this is an example of it it was the most popular one which was an interface you used you would log on to tap says tapsus with a dial up and log on to copy serve grab a bunch of content and go offline again and you would read your content offline and the kinds of content and the kinds of contributions that companies have made to what we think of as normal internet use compu serve invented the chat forum the chat room live chat was created i mean it was happening in other places as well and in other communities i m thinking of marketing in particular but e commerce andelectronic sort of encyclopedias and accessible file uploading and downloading user created libraries a lot of things come to served first which became quite normal costs internet but it doesn t get credited for it so i m not really aiming to savecopy serve in its place in history i m mostly interested in gamers forum and the way that the gamers forum facilitated interactive fiction writing and playing in the era on the right is a snippet of a compu serve gamers forum chat live chat probably a public conference and i know that it s gamers forum because i know those people and the funny thing about this clip is that you ll find it all over the internet and it appears to be the only snippet that the internet has found however there it s a it s a it s a screenshot which is why it s rare i ll talk about it more a little later but because of taxes and other programs like it the artifacts the digital artifacts of compu serve still exist they re just distributed and they re distributed on floppy disks in people s basements now a lot of these floppy disks have been thrown away this is an endangered collection of digital artifacts but all compu serve members have had floppy disks full of the content of gamers forum and that would include all the main styles of communication which were posts public and private emails withinthe forum indexes of files the libraries that the files that were uploaded and downloadable and live conferences we because we use taxes we didn t even think to hit the record button nor did we ask permission we just save transcripts of private and public conferences so one of the first people that i contacted about the idea of restoring this is actually bob bates who you see here in in this chat he he wrote eric lee unready he s an old he s an old text adventure game writer but he worked for legends in this era so i mean maybe i ll i guess i can say it now what s different about compu serve from the other place where he led people and other sort of text adventure peoplewere hanging out on records in fact and rec games in fact starting in the same era starting in the late s was that that wasmore academically oriented so people who are in academic institutions were hanging out and participating and compu serve was sort of more working class citizens i guess you could say it was full of industry people so so we i was a writer of interactive fiction but i hung out it was so fun not only were you hanging out with people you know in the industry there were also science fiction writers everywhere and those of us in gamers forum also hung out in the science fiction forum and it was just a really exciting era to live in and be in disappeared from the world so the specific platform that interests me in that era is a gt the adventure game a toolkit and jimmy ma her who has a blog called a digital antiquarian to me has done more to restore he does i see him as an archaeologist of of of the era he he finds games and he interviews the writers and he s really done more for this era than anybody that i can think of and the screenshot this is from one of his blogs when he talked about gags the generic adventure game system which the hgtv adventuregame system was based on i found gigs because it was installed in xt computer i bought when i was living in boulder colorado in the in the mid s and when you i i wrote so many little games on it and stories interactive stories and games with it that i it was shareware i decided to pay the money and this is not exactly the picture on the left not exactly what i received that because this thisadventure game toolkit software guidebook hadn t yet been made but i got back a slew of floppy disk and learned that again this had been which was written by mark welch had been ritual by david marburg as a gt and one of the things that dave homework did was pick up so mark wells had a game contest in which ran once four games running gags and this code here on the right you see is from the game that one that contest defenses of alice one for looking glass and came back not much changed and you can see that it s sort of as a platform and as a language it s sort of a database where you define a rooms and things and creatures and you there are there are somevariables that you can set for each of these including text variables to make a game a gt use that same sort of model but improve its capacities significantly this is a piece of a gt and what it added was the ability to make man s and so at the bottom of this snippet you ll see that it used flags and variables and that it created what in a regular coding language would be conditional statements but youcan read this as a conditional statement if item to one is present which is likely a flashlight you turn on a flag flip this flag to is probably that the flashlight is lit you switch the locations of the unlike and the lit flashlight and print a particularmessage in this case probably it says you switch on the flashlight something like that and then that command is done and this really increase the capacities of that sort of simple database based platform of gags into something which was really quitepowerful so people wereplaying with a gt in compu serve gamers forum we we were working with other things as well there were people playing with hypertext they were people playing with tad s which is the other quote hobbyist if system but tad s was championed by the records people really and it was directed towards programmers it was more of a programming language and a gt was definitely touted as a system that you could use if you weren t a programmer and you didn t know anythingabout code and i as soon as i found it i started teaching it so i moved to santa cruz california in and i became an artist in residence in schools i was doing children s theatre in schools and i slipped in an if writing workshop into my slate of things i did in schools in santa cruz and found it to be a really wonderful i have platform for kids and i have had some of the kids that i taught to get back to me in later years about the influence of it in their lives so so att was criticizedmostly by the tad s people i think and by who would become the future in form seven people as being primitive in some ways and so i didn t really set out to show all that could be done with a gt but it turned out that that s what i did when i wrote thisgame and what this game is interesting as an ag t artifact but my interest in sharing it with you is not really so much about a gt but about compu serve because i didn t know when i wrote it that it would become important for restoring the life worldof compu serve gamers forum because i didn t know compu serve gamers forum would disappear or that in the thorough way that it didn t disappear so i ve taken some screenshots of the game which is just faster than having me power it up i did low dosebox on to this laptop so that i can play the original file i also have an informed seven port of the game but i just took some screenshots the basic promise of the game is that you are a gender nonspecific self employed computer consultant called rj and you are writing a little app in pascal and i should say that the other thing that died from that era is borland borland a rule the software world at the same time that compu serve ruled the bbs world and the att rule that if world and they all disappeared simultaneously in the mid s so berlin made turbo pascal and it had c and it was paradox and all the things that programmers were doing that felt cutting edge in health borland products so i had my main character be a pascal programmer and what you did when you were a pascal programmer in that time was or any berlin product is that you would go on to compu serve to the borland forum and try to get help so that s the premise of the game is that you have to deliver your product on by the next morning and you have to get on to compu serve and you have to get help and so part of the gameplay when you re in your house is just like any other work of if person based but what was different about this game is that when you turn on your computer you enter a simulated dos environment and at that point you had to usedos commands and regular if commands didn t work you have to navigate to us just as as if it was dos this is what does it look like if you didn t have a lot of stuff in your root directory beep works if you type beep it ll beep i know didn t anticipate at the time that that in the future the hardest part of the game would be navigating dos just knowing how to change a directories you have to change directories to get to the portland that s the fake borland directory to run the software you have to there s a little password puzzle in your own house you have to get the right password and then you use a dial up product to get onto compu serve and this is in fact what it looked like when you logged on to compu serve back in the day i tried my hardest to replicate the feel of the dial up experience in the game including the pace of it the slowness of it and the sounds of it the modem sound that beeps the various power of power down sounds and the famous top of compu serve which would get you to the different things that you could do the forums and shopping and your electronic mail and then there s a little science fiction here the virtual reality interface which wasa little play i have when you re when you re when you re in virtual reality interface that works like ordinary if again person based so but when you re in the simulation of compu serve it feels really a lot like what it felt like when you got there and you went to your forum there would be announcements and so i did my i sort of introduced the characters and the character development and the puzzles through the forums themselves through the announcements sincerest form wishes for a speedy recovery for user was placing the orphan mentalhealth facility after last week s virtual reality role playing adventure get well soon mud puppy so this is the first hint that all is not right and copy serve it s um it s kind of a mystery again and you but to solve it you just have to live through a day on copy serve really you have to pay attention to the conference schedule on different forums and show up there at the right time or the room conference room is empty you have toread the public message boards where people are discussing what s going on here they re discussing what happened to mud puppy well he suffered a psychotic break during the role playing adventure no other information blah blah blah immediately after they asked do you want to play the role play adventure that night and the player has a chance the one thing that i couldn t do with att that i was able to do in inform seven was to allow the player to actually type and post back from so that was the one sort of point at which reality breaks when you re playing in my simulation but you re allowedto a yes or no reply to messages and then different things happen based on whether you re pulling you down here is what it looked like when you downloaded a file if you try to download any of the larger files i m many hours go by and then the file doesn t go through and this is a traditional experience of the time as well downloading was notoriously bad and files would be corrupted it would take incredible amount of time and money to do them so you can only really successfully download tiny files in this game and then they were private messaging and so you get a live email messages just as it felt on top you serve back in the day you would get notification you had a private message we d have to check back to see if they were imposed and then this is a screenshot of a live conference if if you do some other actions you will meet but puppy in a conference telling you that he s not crazy that was a monster in vr and he knows somebody did this to him there s something nefarious going on he disappears and customer service will come and tell you that there s nobody in the conference so there s live conferences you have to fight the clock and not get distracted you join a lot of forums and in order to get onto virtual reality himself all right so how does or fail to preserve its digital history and what i discovered to my sort of joy is that it miraculously survives in bits of digital text when i contacted by bates he went into his basement he brought up some discs he he looked in those disks and he found remarkable artifacts of conferences full of the writers and luminaries of the day chatting with each other right and i have files that i downloaded and i have conference transcripts and i have public posts and i have private posts and private emails and a lot of people have these things so i m hoping to kind of launch this restorative project to me monitor says he will help to get this out to hisreaders who are significant number of them old enough to have this material and it s going to be really exciting to see what i can find so i said i would return back to this little snippet of an artifact that s floating over the internet i immediately knew this was gamers forum besides that they re talking about games here because not only is bob bates here but you see her care this is hercules who was sasabe this started i would i would have to do a whole nother session on sis ops and their significance within communities they weren t just moderators they were something like masters of ceremonies and hosts and hercules was everybody s favorite we all lovedhim and he facilitated a lot of interactive narrative discussions and in fact created for me a room a separate conference room for a group of people that i collaborated with on another game that i wrote back in the era which is certainly canonicalwithin at interactive fiction and i don t know hercules his name and it s a thing that i would i i put this out there like whenever i speak publicly about this hoping that somebody will know who he is and i as i was doing one more vein google search for hercules i found a conversation in some web page somewhere where somebody revealed that they had one spin a copy serve gamers this up and somebody pointedly asks was your name hercules by any chance so i m not the only person out there looking for hercules he was part of that life world and his disappearance is part of sort of the disappearance of that life world there is a chance a remarkable chance that we could get some of it back and however the artifacts are not the community and that s where i m returning to the understanding that i had for my son and his flow experience in oregon trail and you can t really get back real life in the era in which we played but my game cosmos serve does let us briefly re enter it and lets people enter it who never experienced it in the first place so game play and especially games that simulate life of the much derided auto biographical games that most of us right the first time we discover hypertext narrative interactive narrative any kind of my students definitely and those of you who teach will relate to this a lot of their first work is they recreate their walk from their dorm room to the bathroom right and every object in it and we laugh about that a lot the autopilot the autobiographical element of our first interactive narratives but i find these to be really valuable artifacts for the areas in which they re written the simulations of the life worlds around our gamesin these early areas that s the space in which i m working so if you have any interest in playing customer service you can play the original you can download the original from ifttt and it works in dust box i just tried it i didn t need to just setthe settings to slow it down otherwise the it was made for an earlier area very slow processing and so you will it goes too fast and the sound plays incorrectly so you have to slow it down to make it really be like the original but you can more comfortably played on my website the enforcementand i ll take any questions you ve got well thank you so much juice i think we have some very appropriate people in the audience for a discussion about this so what should you what should we ask i think that was first with his little hand up there zach you ve got the microphone oh that was applause oh i felt that was raising your hand okay um all right i mso so sorry joe i m jumping please i m i because i want to throw the florida judy because i was just thinking so much about her experience of uncle roger and the blue notebook as judith sorry judy malloy june event are you know i just the resonance between uncle roger and cosmo serve is so strong wanted to hear what you have to say about that um first of all can you tell me the dates i haven t read the paper through yet i m judith about the dates when you re talking about for this work i joined compu serve gamers forum in or and i started writing this game in and it it was in the att contest in so so the era is really late s to mid s great thank you this is absolutely wonderful i really think terrifically did this and it s also so good that you re able to get back the artifacts from which to do it i know that i i want to say stupidly was probably a good thing to do but i gave all my printouts to my archives at duke and i did not make copies because they were very extensive and i m talking about the printouts from our comm electronic on the well which was a little earlier our calm hen began in but we did not have a large gamer presence so i can certainly see why compu serve filled in that gap so absolutely i used to log into conference because i was in charge of posting leonardo s and putting together we re known as electronic publications and we did we did use copy serve as well as the well and using that as an email but i never spent the time to explore compu serve so i m really thinking i should have and thank you again for doing this and i d also like to point out that getting together the archives and putting all the archives for these things in one place is vitally important and we should all be thinking about this i agree so it s our it s a distributed archive but there s no reason why we can t index that distributed archive with all the places that these things live and this would be a decent intro organization activity for us because i m on the board of interactive interactive fiction technology foundation and we have a lot of great stuff in our archive but i don t think people know what we have in our archive right and i don t know where all these things are archived right and as i do this i was thinking to get my university library involved in it just to make it more secure and to see what they would be willing to invest in supporting any more extensive archiving but i don t see any reason to centralize right we can distribute as long as we re indexing but this is something that we shouldthink about collaboratively cross institutions for sure before things disappear i mean i talked to general madonna who is the virtual presenting virtual worlds study was my colleague here at the university of illinois and the first thing he said to me he said you have a very endangered collection right he said every every month you wait is another box of floppy disks thrown out so that was kind of sobering to think about really for doing this kind of work so i i put in this paper to force me to launch this project even before i have a grant or whatever i should just start this is a fabulous thoughts about this i was going to ask do you need to because yeah to what extent do you collect all this sort of ephemeral stuff around the works oh but you re muted danny no coffee yet so so judas a couple of things first we ve developed in the lab and meta data schema for electronic literature for the next right which is a big archive that we ve built over the past three years leo and i and few other people involved in this and it s gone live now so we re ready to start taking in information taking more data and we develop a meta data schema that includes the kind of functionality and in software you know dependencies that mods does not dress so what i can do is give you that spreadsheets you can see wonderful fields that we re looking at once you fill that out and you want to begin to organize this stuff then we can work through cell because we built in the cell taxonomy into this spreadsheetfor cross walking purposes and then we can start to index all of these things across all the cell partner so this is something that can be done on a grand scale and as far as your collection goes it d be nice to have some sort of the next half the diversity next and a regular just kind of like em citizen a wonderful solution for you know making the information you know available to people so i d recommend you take that information you ve got about your work and put into cell so that people can get to it through it i mean through the outset so that people can get that information if you re ever wanting to turn that into an archive in the next we can set up a whole collection called copy server some are gay or early games and all of it can be then ingested into the larger library that we re building and it all is availablethrough that through the next system so you can either read it downloaded etc so that s the schema that we re developing for the electronic literature stuff that we re collecting for the organization we have works in it right now and there s going to be another thousand by the end of summer but certainly we ve got the foundationnow to work either with you to for guidance or and or and helping with getting into getting into what else it sorry i m still haven t had any coffee so i m still just kind of my photo morning stuff but they will definitely talk i mean i think that that we need to not reinvent the wheel and we don t want multiple if we re going to coordinate on this we need a schema that we can all use so that s the indexing is effective so not just sort of this project that i have which i probably will launch as a project and also our if tiff archive could use a professional archivist and so we ve been looking at trying to get some money to do that but i one of the things that so a lot of people put in the timeline your own fears about the degradation right of things out of stasis for that for that post from jason scott about it isn t just that the things are thrown away the things that exist are degrading right so we really it really is a race and we need to get on it right that s how i feel about it because i mean i had this thought through the years and it finally started to feel are urgent at some point and it is urgent you know collectively so so thank you well we ll talk the other thing that we re doing is we have project deep freeze going on in the lab and we re ripping information off lobbies and putting in things that are copyrighted we re putting into a deep freeze so that we don t upset peoples and copyright issuesand things like that are open we re making it available so that s the project that nicholas schiller is doing right now and he presented about it yesterday that i m interested in that too because the three things that mcdonough and that group we re talkinghad both kinds of floppy disks sort of running and then but then you have your tape drive backup machines are they still working because we we backed up or flop is to tape drive through a couple different generations but there s only so long you canclutter your basement with one of every kind of computer you ve ever had just so you can keep that up and you hope that you passed everything forward all the way to the cd right at the at the point when we got to there so there s a lot of media so the software hardware but that s only one part then you have the legal part so you mentioned i love this deep freeze idea we archive we put it away until it s sort of copyright free or we can use it but it s not something like compu serve i don t have permission so i have these wonderful transcripts from what we re private conferences private chats right and although we all recorded them did we have permission to record them and and even if i might legally be able to make public those conversations do i ethically can i should i do that and what about private emails like that s a that s those are veryimportant points because i know on the well i don t know about congress or but on the well we had a you own your own words policy and you were not allowed to replicate anybody else s words without asking for permission so for instance when i did an online version of bad information which is an early work i did on the well i had to ask everyone have about participants remission and the issue still comes up no i got a general permission that i could do that i could reuse that anytime but when you re looking at say replica replicating conversations on a cen you re dealing with the fact that you have to ask everybody permission if you want to use their words and the same is true i just posted in in discord a conversation that on cooley and i had with me dawn about a early hypertext work she had created and i recall that in order to reprint that conversation and i had to ask everyone permission and some people s words are left out because he didn t it did not give us permission or they did not respond with comcast service that we all use handles youoh yeah i don t know who the people are so don t know me so the problem was me coming and saying hi and hoping to find my own copy serve is that i didn t use my name judas i was taylor brown who s a character and larry nevins world the luckiest woman in the world that was me and and that s what they knowand and that s what they know me as and i can t i don t know their names to even get their permission and some of those conversations are remarkable i was i went to graduate school in the in the mid s and that was toward the end of my companiesbefore company was sold to aol right at the end and i did a bunch of interviews for a paper that i didn t end up writing but i interviewed all these women gamers in the mid s about their experiences as women in that era it s it s a treasure rightit s a treasure those interviews but what can i do with it now i don t know what i can do with that material any so we ve been given lots of emails from richard holton dana larsen and so i went through when i was putting that into the archives into the next i went through the emails with the artist and determine which ones were viable to put out on the line online which ones we had to put away into the deep freeze ironically when i went to duke to see judy will always papers steffi strickland s papers and rob candles stephanie strict was emails were all there every one of them and it was you know it was interesting so i was looking for something about slipping glimpse and all of her emails about and the kind of comments and stuff that was collected in is open at duke library from stephanie strickland femalemail early day stuff from ios development and i was surprised that all of that was available for me to reach our owner and i said did you make this did you make this available you know this is all out there free she didn t realize it but it was some pretty interesting comments about various people community was like oh god i was definitely gotta go we gotta go can fix that so one of the girls on my sabbatical next year s to meet stephanie and durham and go through all those archives and clean that stuff up so that s right so this is fascinating because these these kinds of artifacts are our world artifacts right that the texture of our worlds and our lives and our relationships and our thoughts about i mean what did we talk about when we were chattingand we re just always talking about literature right we weren t it s talking about our works and our games and our writing we were talking about the world and politics and we were reading the same books and we were it d be it was the experience of being alive in that era so so that s that s part of what i was trying to get at at this paper and with the story of my son which is that our our our interactive narrative worlds are in worlds and that restoring the the narrativeworld also means somehow accessing the real world the real life around them and that s harder to come by so you know what does that mean in terms of archiving and and curating right and that s where sort of simulations i if we have enough of theseif you we have enough of these digital artifacts you can simulate and let people re enter like as a curation experience sort of re enter and experience what it was what it was like then you can t make that world come back because real life isn tback that you can curate it in interesting immersive ways that people can enter and experience again i think that s vitally important i know you re i was really impressed with your emulation i m from my heart the work i get most inquiries about is brown house kitchen that i can t respond to not inquiries i can t respond to his brown house kitchen which i did it on lambda move when i was at park on working pablo curtis now that work was available on lambda move until i got run down and in a serious accident and there was a rule of them to move that if you did not enter it and allow him to move in three months they would take your work down so guess what i didn t even notice that so about a year later because there were other things i had to attend to such as walking on crutches for the rest of my life and i still get up i wrote two book chapters on that work but i still get a lot of inquiries about can i emulate it well you know what i might be able to emulate that work but i took all the printouts i have printouts of how i developed it i have printouts of all the code was written in a lambda mu code which was a cross between c plus and list and guess what i gave them all to do now that means they do exist and i think that s important the mistake i made was not copying that myself because it never occurred to me that if i wanted that i would have to go to duke although the original curator there didn t say they would copyset for me i think this is a couple hundred pages but i guess the point i m making is a give yourself to to sustainable archives and be keep copies yourself and one more thing was during the pandemic and especially in the united states even before the pandemic when budget cuts were coming through with the recession there was so little money to travel so when i went to duke to do that research i was the only person that ever looked at judy malloy stephanie circling or rob rob kindles collections i went back for a second time i was still the second person and the reason was problematic about that is it means here s his treasure trove i mean i was looking at judy stuff oh my god it s just this is marvelous right but the problem is somebody s got to fly there fly to durham you know took the time to get there yeah they have to get funding for that i had someone else use the archives recently who someone who was writing a paper on early early work onours takes on genetic engineering and i happened to have an okay genetic engineering project so they went down to look at that we hadn t talked thoroughly enough so i she didn t wasn t aware that actually the entire files for okay genetic engineering or not at duke they re in a storage and in richmond california to which i do not have access to because i m not in californiaand i don t travel easily so i m duke actually my contract was duke is for electronic literature so i didn t give them the occasional engineering files but once again here we there s a lot of issues involved in in you know what s a work of art what goes in your archives i don t think you know unless you dini has done an awful lot of work on this mad christian bomb has done work on this we need to have funding for more work on this well the thing i was going to say finish by saying is that the nice thing about the rubinstein is that it s like i mean i can call them and say i need this stuff and they would email it to me the ransom library unless you re physically there theywon t give you anything you can get i couldn t get to michael joyce s papers for the book i m writing right now until i fly to austin to do it and i couldn t get into the music into the center because it s locked down for endemic so what we re trying to build with the next is the ability to make all this stuff available without somebody having a friggin travel so that s something we re in the middle now of starting phase four which is our is digitizing all the paper archives and we have eight boxes of turbulence with step by cory cory archangel mike mcgruder and we re talking major stuff that anybody wouldlove to download so that s the next one of the next things we re doing is getting that stuff available so people just click a link and download where they want without having to fly somewhere or call somebody i mean that s the future of libraries museums and stuff and as far as the physical media we re pre modeling all of those things so people can see them they re looking like in real in real time so i mean there s just there s new ways to think about this stuff and that s what we re trying to accomplish and then one other thing about judy s collection is that she s got you know the uncle roger floppy disk right that s nowhere near the archives you have to separate so you you look in the archives you see the paper that was packaged in but the floppy disk or somewhere else so nothing is put in situ like in context of each other and i m not being ugly about this i m just it s just it s not the way we function in our world it s the way libraries have function the print or well you know because with this you know i do understand its policy on that issue i mean anybody could take that disc and that may be one of maybe three or four discs i have or i give them to variousplaces of the original uncle roger i and it s pretty easy to destroy the discs when somebody could walk into that library and if they had access to the disk do something that would make it inoperable so i do understand their point of view at that issue but a moment at least they re taking your disks and they are ripping them rather than making sure that they are doing that in a great job with your stuff one of the things that if tiff has been talking about it s not in the front of anybody s mind but it is on mine which is being proactive in archiving and that s going to authors and saying please don t throw away your notes if you you know when you re cleaning your office you know and people always surprised to be told that they are of historical significance right they re like what might have my sketches my mind why would you want that stuff right it s well maybe you don t see significance now but somebody in years might be looking for it and wanting it and so being proactive about it rather than waiting for people it s self selecting if you wait for people who see themselves as historicallyinteresting right we need the people who don t see themselves as historically interesting and go after them and ask for their stuff right and get permissions from the gecko and and actually be more active collecting are the things that we value in our in our community across it so are we approaching the end of the the panel what s the low do you know what the next thing on the agenda is right now right okay yeah we re supposed to be on a break now and at is the keynote okay and just translate that into how hello minutes in a minute oh well then we better end the session so we can all move around get a cup of tea or something and then we get the keynote
