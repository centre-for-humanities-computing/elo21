the art object in a post digital world some artistic tendencies in the use of instagram maría goicoechea de jorge complutense university of madrid this paper aims to reflect on two labels that have been used to define sets of artifacts born out of the same context but evoking different connotations i refer to the terms post digital and post internet both terms allude to a post stage a leap that announces a cultural shift perceived by artists but difficult to pinpoint and demarcate with precision a prefix that might refer to after chronologically as well as beyond spatially often used to highlight that what has been superseded is the novelty and exceptionality of the internet and digital technology actually these terms address the fact that digital media is no longer a form of mediation but it has become our ontology though this new form of being is of such a diffuse complex and assembled nature not even haraway could have anticipated it triggered by impulses of excess and overindulgence on the one hand or sustainability and preservation on the other post internet and post digital art emerge from a networking and tech savvy sensibility that has altered the relation between artist audience and art object in particular i am going to focus on the work of artists that use instagram as an art gallery for exhibiting their work almudena lobera andrés reisinger lucy hardcastle or to sabotage the platform from the inside amalia ulman cory arcangel bearing a family resemblance to electronic literature these works also explore the narrative process in the construction of an artist s identity the changing territories of human machine artist spectator interactions and digital analogue materializations the art objects they produce can be classified as phygital physical digital constructs that inhabit in a myriad of different possibilities of mediation and convergence the physical and the digital spaces of mixed reality as artists explore the platform s potential as exhibition space advertising site and conversation aisle their phygital objects reflect the tensions between a nostalgia for an analogue craftsmanship which rebels against machinic perfection and an interrogation of human creativity that propels us into the future through an ever more profound symbiosis with our technological habitus part i defining post digital and post internet aesthetics let us start by attempting to define what is the meaning attributed to the label post digital which is the main concept i would like to address when do we start to hear this term it has been around since the year when electronic music composer kim casone inspired by negroponte s sentence the digital revolution is over decided to refer to a type of musical experimentation emerging from non academic self taught composers as postdigital in his artice the aesthetics of failure the post digital aesthetics according to casone was developed in part as a result of the immersive experience of working in environments suffused with digital technology but more specifically from the attention paid to the failure of these technologies system crashes bugs glitches distortion noise floor signals that these technologies were as imperfect as the humans who made them and which were incorporated in the musical compositions from that moment the post digital has been associated with a process of amateurization in art everybody can become an artist using diy techniques low tech recycled materials and software found objects and tools lying around the house moreover the post digital condition requires that the artist nearly everyone becomes his or her own agent using platforms such as instagram as exhibition venues to attract audiences and make their art viral within this framework we assist to the growing importance of user generated content in a transmedia ecology which has contributed to exacerbate the overabundance of data images videos and to instil the logic of extruding data both as creative practice and as a method to attribute cultural value as it happens with other words such as postmodernism or post pop post digital implies more than anything a change in attitude emerging from a framework in which technology is naturalized a post digital aesthetics would be one in which the artist through his or her creations provokes a tension that makes visible the interpenetration of digital technology in every layer of our lives we could say it coexists with the digital and even the pre digital but it involves a critical attitude regarding the notion of digital progress questioning the positivist ideology that assumes technological development as a linear progress inevitable neutral and ultimately beneficial the post digital attitude has also been associated with a nostalgic retromaniac turn cramer but from the vantage position of one who already dominates the present technology or we should rather say that a post digital aesthetics makes the distinction between old and new media obsolete by eclectically appropriating techniques and materials from an array of digital and analogical practices to create something new at once strangely familiar and awry it also supposes a turn of the screw regarding previous strategies moving from technology appropriation from a marxist perspective harnessing the power technology can grant us to reappropriation as in tactical media repurposing existing technology so at to undo lorde s statement that the master s tools will never dismantle the master s house from the promise of fluid identity of the body exposition and postproduction or postdigitalization of identity in the social networks of the post digital age the digital age to concurrently at the beginning of the st century a series of artists began to reflect on the impact of the use of the internet and its technologies in our life but using creative venues outside the internet returning to the plasticity of objects in the physical space of the gallery artist cory arcangel explicitly addressed this decision it is not until digital technology manifests itself physically that we can easily grasp its effects on our society and the environment greene naftali np this type of art that thematises the effects of extensive internet use in disconnected creative practices was called post internet art marisa olson one of its early proponents describes it as the process of creating art following time spent utilizing and exploring the world wide web what is made after is the product of this excessive computer use or indulgence of the internet the internet has shifted from being an escapist pastime from the world to become the world one seeks to escape from she quotes artie vierkant s the image object post internet whose own definition of the term describes it a result of the contemporary moment inherently informed by ubiquitous authorship the development of attention as currency the collapse of physical space in networked culture and the infinite reproducibility and mutability of digital materials olson brian droitcour in his demolishing post why i hate post internet art adds post internet art does to art what porn does to sex implying that post internet artists care more about the idea of success in the art world than anything else no matter how lacking they may be in the craftsmanship abilities one associates with artistic production according to him they have mimicked in their pieces the visual vocabulary of product advertising and brand communication strategies that proliferate in the networks as a result it s boring to be around post internet art it s not really sculpture it doesn t activate space it s frontal designed to preen for the camera s lens it s an assemblage of some sort and there s little excitement in the way objects are placed together and nothing is well made except for the mass market products in it of course though droitcour s criticism of post internet art might be acutely insightful with regards some of its products one needs to delve deeply into the matter to understand what is valuable in each contribution but we should also ask are the post digital and post internet aesthetics one and the same or can we already perceive a division between the good and the bad art along the lines it is boring and commercial and thus we are going to call it post internet art or it is cool and inspiring we are going to call it post digital in some of the works of the artists we are going to discuss later these accusations appear as unfair since they certainly show their virtuosity both in the traditional arts as in the sculptural works of almudena lobera and in their knowledge of code as in the works of cory arcangel but what i am particularly interested in analysing is their activation of space by introducing in the physical space of the gallery the communication habits of the internet networks and platforms they challenge our perception of the medium both physical and virtual and highlight its collapse convergence and multi faceted condition the post digital aesthetics pierces the dichotomy between the virtual and the physical space producing artifacts that can no longer be read or enjoyed fully in one or the other space but exist somewhere in the middle in fact the phygical artifacts inhabit the realms of what is being called mixed reality which expands along the reality virtuality continuum milgram as schnabel proposes these realms include real reality mixed reality with amplified reality augmented reality mediated and diminished reality augmented virtuality virtualised reality and virtual reality amplified reality ar shifts the perspective from the viewer as in augmented reality s hardware which projects images onto the object that only the viewer with an electronic device can see to the objects by providing the objects with additional layers of data diminished reality dr refers to techniques for visually concealing eliminating and seeing through real objects augmented virtuality av refers to the merging of real world objects into virtual worlds other writers however refer to the term extended reality xr as the encompassing term and mixed reality as its central area in any case the essential quality of mixed reality is that the digital and the physical planes coexist and are integrated either by introducing the digital object in the space around us or the physical objects in the virtual plane thus the phygital ontology of postdigital art is not of a single quality but rather it stretches along a spectrum of possibilities and positions itself along the multiplicity of layers that form this hybrid mixed reality physical objects in digital environments digital objects in physical environments phygital objects existing at the same time in both physical and digital spaces ar artifacts complementing the incomplete physical object or plane of existence digital objects that have cannibalized an analogical technique or that propose a reencounter with the physical plane in trompe l oeil materializations etc the range of possibilities seems to be as wide as the imagination of the artist but each combination is indirectly posing questions and positioning itself regarding our conception of reality and the correct balance between ourselves and our technological prostheses moreover in order to be really post digital these artifacts also have to be submitted to post digital processes operations that imbue them with an extra layer of surreality and imagination through our study of a few post digital artists we are going to attempt to pinpoint some of these processes virtualized reality vr immerses viewers in a virtual reconstruction of real world spaces and events incorporating real images and depth information computed from these images and allowing the viewers to select their perspective part ii post digital processes and instagram recycling technological detritus by nostalgically recycling and repurposing old media and technology post digital artists highlight the speed with which the capitalist economy makes everything obsolete artist cory arcangel for example seems to have found the proper amount of time one needs to go back to make the retro use of old programs and technology cool again and that is five or six years in one of his most famous works super mario clouds he alters the graphic card of the game so that all the graphics are eliminated except the background a blue sky with moving clouds fig fig super mario clouds this interesting move of isolating the background is also shared with casone s post digital electronic music composers for whom concepts such as detritus by product and background or horizon are the new focus of their attention as casone writes the basic composition of background is comprised of data we filter out to focus on our immediate surroundings the data hidden in our perceptual blind spot contains worlds waiting to be explored choosing to shift our focus there will involve exploring the boundary of normal functions and uses of software it will also allow us to pay more attention to that which we discard the detritus of contemporary society may have more to say about us than the perfected piece of art post digital ekphrasis recontextualizing the platform s communicative strategies spanish artist almudena lobera puts a frame to the background the landscape so that we can become aware of the prominence it has achieved however the viewer is not there it is only seeing the picture which has been emptied of human figures helping us reflect on the simulacra or the second hand nature of our quotidian experiences this image also represents the transfer of receptive modes across media and the impossibility of an unmediated glance fig un espectáculo para la vista a sight to behold installation in public space lobera a plastic artist that connects classical sculpture and still life painting with computer programs has become relevant to spanish audiences thanks to her active role in instagram where she communicates frequently with her audience and following ekphrasis is the verbal representation of a visual representation it is a type of intermediality in which the creator chooses a different medium than expected in traditional ekphrasis the written medium to describe an image or visual representation we can refer to a type of ekphrasis characteristic of the post digital era when a publication medium platform or format is selected for a purpose for which it was not originally designed for example the use of instagram and scrolling to animate a series of images such as the one made by the red lion advertising agency in toronto canada to promote the toronto silent film festival in its edition see https www youtube com watch v dvytk p if work shown at fibart festival internacional de benicàssim july and at faena art commissions miami beach dec arcangel postdigital tendencies she also feels compelled to bring these digital consumption and communication modes to the physical gallery in her work stories she proposes another way of visiting an art exhibition modifying the logic of the location of the work the space and the viewer in this case her work will be the one that moves by means of a conveyor belt parallel to the perimeter of the room floor moving continuously with a sample of pieces located in it these pieces selected and organized so that the spectator can construct his or her own particular narrative compose a unitary exhibition inside another the overarching one mimics the exploration of art pieces in instagram moving from one piece to another with a finger and reminds the viewer that the exhibition continues living in other spaces as spectator you are propelled to take an active role as you let the exhibition pass in front of you and are invited to record it with your smartphone uploading the video to your own stories in instagram fig fig hands of spectators and detail of stories solid vector still life stories exhibition at espacio cdmx mexico city visit http cargocollective com almudenalobera stories with this project almudena lobera wants to transmit a critical and ironic staging of the prevailing consumer and communication mechanisms in our days in this case the virtual spaces of the internet and the physical space of the gallery are clearly demarcated though the modes of communication and image consumption of both spaces contaminate one another in an endless cycle of conspicuous consumption and production cory arcangel whose main approach is to intervene and appropriate technological gadgets introducing a change sometimes a glitch to make the familiar turn uncanny has also a series of pieces in which he externalizes and intervenes instagram s communication practices through the use of bots as in we deliver the king checked by the queen or in the work of unpronounceable name in fig arcangel presents video recordings of automated performances in instagram producing nonsensical and disturbing pieces that completely obliterate aesthetic contemplation fig title ᔕσ ᑌ ιỗή øｕ ｎ ᗴđ ｅ ί 匚 έ к β т є q ภ by cory arcangel dual channel screen recording of a live bot performance on instagram january curiously enough marisa olson describes post internet art as coming from a post ekphrastic image philosophy a moment of discernment that the image could speak for itself metareflexively without the need for words and thus turning the rhetorical exercise of ekphrasis obsolete however this intermedial practice as we have seen is metamorphosed into a particular kind of post digital ekphrasis when for example the artist uses another medium the art exhibit to describe instagram s image consumption habits or uses instagram for a purpose for which it was not originally designed a bot performance and in this way exposes the perversion of the platform s communicative strategies augmented virtuality or how to regain the artistic commercial aura in instagram andrés reisinger a barcelona based d designer has also become a referent in post digital artifacts using instagram as communication venue and virtual gallery he introduces physical objects in d virtual spaces of a surreal quality to recreate a poetic background in which these objects obtain their sense of belonging in this case the physical object a sculptural armchair fig for example is inscribed in the virtual plane to the point that it loses its connection with the real material world and acquires an ethereal aura the aura of the art object is regained through its virtualization instead of appealing to a unique existence in the physical space and time the digital space provides for a new sensory experience of distance between the viewer and the object fig screenshot of the video to advertise the hortensia armchair by moooi see video here https reisinger studio hortensiaxmoooi fig lucy hardcastle studio in instagram lucy hardcastle studio based in london and with nearly followers in instagram investigates the tensions between technology and traditional craft as they observe in the description of one of their projects their inspiration is drawn from the post internet ethos of being constantly connected and constantly seeking visual gratification in this case hardcastle like reisinger is inspired by online digital art to create physical objects in this case printed fabrics but her intention is to confront play a mirror game between the physical and the digital plane challenging in the process the perfectionism in both the fashion and digital design worlds the journey moves from the qualities of physical objects like liquids ice soft materials and their textures which are then conveyed to the digital objects such as images and d sculptures through rendering software and then suffused back in physical materials the printed fabrics that are used to create wallpapers rugs curtains etc the online object is recreated physically confronting the differences in materiality between the two planes the digital and the physical one the clone of the other and back again the result is a series of printed fabrics with illusionary textures and digital tromp l oeil effects since quote extracted from their description of glow a project that explores tactile features in physical and digital objects lucyhardcastle com glow the end products lack those qualities that have been recreated in d such as ripples roughness contours and even temperatures the end result establishes also a game with the spectator that consumes these images through instagram since it becomes a challenge to decipher which is the digital object and which is a photograph of a physical one reproducing the digital characteristics as we have seen lobera places the digital consumption and communication habits in the physical space of the gallery while reisinger inserts the physical object in a digital landscape and hardcastle moves back and forth between the two planes as an exploration of their mutual influences and tensions in all three cases a return to the physical object and to craftsmanship is important instagram is a channel to exhibit their exploration along the reality virtuality continuum and showcase their creations there are other artists however whose intention is to address more directly the role of the platform in the configuration of our consumer habits and thus they end up sabotaging the platforms from the inside flouting the platform s veracity principle one technique to do so is to ironically reproduce the platforms aestheticized content as boris groys has observed today everyone is subjected to an aesthetic evaluation everyone is required to take aesthetic responsibility for his or her appearance in the world for his or her self design where it was once a privilege and a burden for the chosen few in our time self design has come to be the mass cultural practice par excellence amalia ulman argentina has used instagram to both construct her work and expose the toxic nature of its own framework the general theme of her net art is the way in which relationships are built from appearances which she has exploited by creating her own fictional narratives around identity construction in instagram her most celebrated project to date is excellences and perfections which flouts flagrantly the already weakened veracity principle attributed to online profiles fig during six months of ulman built a story of an extreme make over through instagram posts that were not her own even though she signed them with her name confusing to see this work visit https www newmuseum org exhibitions view amalia ulman excellences perfections friends and acquaintances alike it recounted the experiences of a girl in her twenties looking for success in the city of los angeles from the apparently idyllic life of a naïve girl to the struggles of the sexy vamp she goes through break up with her boyfriend injects botox falls into drugs undergoes cosmetic surgery for breast augmentation suffers a nervous breakdown and after hitting rock bottom resurfaces she built a complete story made with hashtags and in the image and likeness of the profiles of many girls her age that she found on the social network fig and images from ulman s excellences and perfections fig image of intimidad romero s facebook project amalia ulman like intimidad romero plays with identity construction in social networks blurring the boundaries between lived reality masquerade and pastiche their work is prototypically a post internet product born out of excessive exposition to internet images they denounce how the networks have enslaved us into living for them exposing more and more of our post produced real life instead of facilitating the promised liquid identity that would allow you to be whoever you desired at least online in the case of intimidad romero her artistic name and that of her facebook project the pixilation and thus self censure to which she subjected her own images fig provoked facebook to close her account in both cases what is subversive is that the real identity of the artist remains elusive either by faking a banal yet popular ego or by self censuring it before the platform has a chance to do it thus the artist invents new norms for the algorithm to deal with implausible exhibits and data collection joshua citarella s work compression artifacts also belongs to this second stage in the relationship between art and the digital sphere initiated by the web and its new forms of participation in this case citarella addresses the dominance of the digital networks as new exhibition spaces even before the covid pandemic and plays with the array of possible mediations between physical and virtual representations for this piece citarella has constructed in a secret location what appears to be an exhibition space there is no way any spectator can reach it physically since we have not been informed of its existence prior to its deconstruction the construction was performed in front of a live feed broadcast during daylight hours the process was thus recorded and then postproduced to augment its size or to decrease it at will its objects also dematerialized by fire eventually everything is brought to its ashes what remains is the process as recorded in videos and photographs disseminated in the networks as in almudena lobera s stories in this piece we find an exhibition inside another but what is at stake really in this performatic procedural work is its implicit commentary on the importance granted to the exhibition space the container and conversely the art objects that comprise the installation become banal again it is the context the background which is laid bare and questioned read a to of http classic rhizome org artbase artwork available at http joshuacitarella com artifacts html statement intimidad romero s project visit fig joshua citarella s compression artifacts conclusion artists use of instagram and other platforms is twofold at once it benefits from their dissemination potential as it also poses a critical stance regarding their algorithms logic they are aware of the commercial objectives of the platforms and try to skew or appropriate them depending on their own intentions as kenneth goldsmith has also observed while we play the instagram game by liking and reposting photos the apparatus knows otherwise a like is a way for the shareholder to verify that there are consumers populating the program for spanish critic juan martín prada the immateriality of the net art work was a problem for its commercialization and post internet art implies a return to the object not only to make a clearest statement as arcangel defends but to be able to sell it nowadays we could say following latour that we were never modern not even postmodern since we have managed to commercialize virtual objects by making them scarce unique once again through blockchain technology the non fungible tokens nft have returned if not the aura to the work of art at least its monetary value in the same way that marisa olson identified post internet art as a type of production that was not strictly computer internet based but rather that it could be identified as any type of art that is in some way influenced by the internet and digital media post digital electronic literature is also experiencing this overture towards other works that might not be strictly classified as electronic literature but spring from a similar experimentation with platforms and artistic creation traversed by or going through computer programs and machinic spaces and reaching out to find new audiences as close relatives in the artistic field we have identified the same impulses in post digital electronic literature as we have perceived in these artists a nostalgic mixture of analogic and digital techniques a renewed interest in technological obsolescence and sustainability and an inquiring attitude towards an ever expanding technological mediation though it is difficult to demarcate these categories we observe that we can identify two trends along the commercial or critical positioning of the authors though many will mix these trends in their works if post internet art is an art of conspicuous consumption in which the self aware internet user makes post internet art as a prosumer every time he she visits these installations and participates in the performance post digital art focuses on the transcendence of the medium by recontextualizing recuperating reusing ad infinitum fragments of old and new media calling for the need to find an equilibrium between the different spaces we inhabit virtual and real identifying the particular qualities textures structures in each of the manifold layers of reality we move about but what happens when digital technology is capable of reproducing to perfection the qualities of the physical medium does the traditional association and classification of art objects with their medium disappear in never ending cycles of appropriation and re appropriation production and digital post production inscription and recontextualization mediation and remediation where does one locate the importance of the medium or should we conclude as spanish critic germán sierra believes that in post digital art the medium is destroyed with the message re inscription contextualization and maybe destroyed is excessive but certainly in post digital art the medium is problematized strained its limits exposed however we do not seem to have moved beyond the need of self referencing the medium constantly as all nascent media do and as we know electronic literature has done for a long time since new combinations of mixed reality become possible every day continuously expanding our horizon of expectations what is certain is that the aesthetical experience has been forever altered by the platforms modes of consumption and production veering audiences to a perpetual state of distraction
