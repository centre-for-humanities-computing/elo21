oh i m before you begin i would like to first record it and then show you the jingle and then i ll stop screen sharing and you can talk about it exactly okay so can i start recording now yes yeah okay thank you okay so um i m doing it again so my god yes michael you can share the presentation please because now he s recording st things well our presentation is neither archaeology or genealogical approach to peruvian electronic poetry and yes so this isan invitation that michael and i do since two years ago the because we realized that in our country there is not much research on the matter but there are interesting unnecessary work and next michael please okay sorry there so thoroughly empire three america trilogy means for us the possibility of understanding a history of poetry from the influence and relationship of the works with our means of production so that is to change that traditional vision so worth one in which the environment can be defining criteria and not a forgotten on surprise one for us is like marshall mcluhan said the medium is the message what you see is a single metro halfway mass or five meters of points from night i work by the peruvian poet carlos kendall and math printed bite me nervous is the on the on the right from casa godless who your sister maria you brothers this printing machine is responsible for literally mother modernization in peru so it s too important for us to start with this it s interesting that this printing company has print that or the descent and abundance hard work like this one single mccomas that refers to the media everywhere seeing it for it try to emulate the cellulite of the cinema in a book format which also has to be surely as personality and interior design movement his work is important because carlos agenda not only refers to a technological million he also executives it s in his work so this is the beginning for us to our work from the media archaeology okay so this is what our classification has been both built around the medium and his characteristic we have called this route from the mechanical muse to the electronic news so the llama some mechanical alamosa electronica so we have three pattern is identified by color intensity in our work so at first you have words that use the computer in the in the left okay and decide that your jobs that have been created and pro and sold for the computer and also have been createda and do it for the computer on internet platforms or on local platforms so there is two ways from that word from the computer in the middle you have the pattern that we call works that referred to cybernetics pre computer so here you have a the words that refer to cybernetics throughout the language can be informed on content and on the right you have the pattern words designed for nll media these are words created and sold for another of media that it can be in a printed on paper no it means that can be do and paper from another local media or printed machine to see dr michael the next place okay so did this vision from the media archaeology which aims to show an aspect relegate to the poetic tradition for a peruvian wedding tradition a set the policy community of constructing a genealogy that understand that the history of this works a is not linear is a is different is intelligence it also allow us to locate basis on patterns that the characteristic of work that use digital under relation with others experiment experimentation a prior to them we can see that that peruvian experimental boy tick works from before to use a computer or those made in another media breath sent elements that yellow with those that use these technologies so to establish this relationship with the pattern of the media archaeology and the genealogical we have identified five common patterns so michael can you open please the presentation and moral so this is a first first aa tried to understand the genealogical a peruvian media so we have five a common patterns that allow organization the following a missile ization effort this realization in which this is to get them deliveries our growth together now neither geology and genealogy and so the first pattern we we we went to show you is michael can you is okay this is the quality i said a circle of grass yes so in this partner are the works that use be sweetie in the space either on the blank sheet or on that computer interface now so there is what the nice well it also allows them to highlight a condition of movement soimportant for the first avant garde experiments okay there s a lot of works that are influenced by an experimental of avant garde if we could call them works that explore this like poetry the other the other name to recognize these words can be also be shy boy so an example of this column of movement patterns that exist it could be between career solar warden and if you look there is the the pattern of this relative but also in in the space and laser and more your years later there s another similar word from michael yotel who is also here michael can you show the part where are your work where thereis your work yes so if if you can see their mental carla so when baldwin is has a similar similar patterns or or the work of michael have similar patterns that hunger salute him this word for my goal is a vocalist for beaten going oh boy emma but could be also by will win and everything by wisdom in a in a point from michael so in this pattern from miss wiley d you also have a mic but also there s a lot of books michael can you open the the the presentation for because we went to see the others so yes michael and i are not the only one so you have a also in the visual pattern you have cancer can go and matt can you show the the first migraine see is the murder four year scholarship endo and math okay then next a california matt is from and then you got to have your solo good in and then you have michael if you want you can move closer waterfrom the work rosa or rose from then you have coziness your lopez that is a is a rescue from from a migraine that he rescued this work for mlm house see maybe you you are showing my presentation for themselves okay just one person s account list and then you you have michael okay a also you have a enrique bail metaverse was initially did this is a work that is made him with an earlier them into no i don t remember how you set it up into english my good reality reality augmented augmented reality augmented reality this this word is a real mental mental reality a you can play this with your cell phone so you find bombs in you can find points in the reality where there is a sort of a sudden video okay thanks mike please return to the personalization so that was the first butter we we can identify then we got the stick of butter in this is the allergy and that is the media okay this this partner shows that works that in their construction show an awareness of means of production of stand up this means that they are there are points or are this with works in which the media needs use of part of their meaning know it for example this is the media and so you have there again girls again the mat it has to record horace key there is a buddha casa water beta gloria humaneness rafael garcia was it ambien and recover it and then also to and recover so an interesting example can be a the one carried out by forgetful roski and night with a nickel and can meet with a computer and that same operation with code ascii i m boudicca is carried out or was the same or similar operation it is carried out by berra and girlish humans with the work that his name in english is not the naming a spanish modify printingand and and in which they modified a matrix printer to print but this ok so the the top butter is that a scenario he knows if you can see my going to charity yes so in this pattern here are the words that privilege the sound dimension integration and use recording a programming or artificial intelligence for their realization this is a case of for example in one go agent some and recorded on a tape callers a piece in which the names of the colors are harmonically repeat michael as you can open the colors maybe yo maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie maddie yo where are they where are they where are they very good okay so cola for nagel sunset and repeat a yellow green red and blue and different sounds so similar and work it could be with programming a barbell from my goal migrating you open barbell so in this work my good but my bed is which is the some dimension appears when we interact with that interface if you can interact manga ma saying saying so tom robin ma hey go jim like aaliyah ran ran thanks mike thanks so in that part time it s also in other words from our leftovers that it s a word that it s and takes some parts of ct hagen son is done with artificial intelligence this and michael can you open a presentation to see so you have michael yes and no it s not it s the open the presentation is not okay and you also have a national office okay well the the mark thanks east hypertext the fourth pattern in hypertext and here that highlight the words that are based on lincoln s of data or from quotes or link okay an example of this is quite a meaningful ways in via potato this is analogous media is is think until for the paper in i work in which the links between the birth are established by number yes in the same way militia for later in the last year we just got four ladies here with us class at this our words oyster for us a work related with collaborative in voice to text and hyperlinks okay there s not a lot much time for me so i m going to the fifth the fifth pattern please i m taking note of the fifth pattern thanks for better these are words that use mathematical operations to from the same elements points create other basic forms see the permutation and an example of this is it with her for god willing and some an example of this is with jorge guard williamson again who in had a permutations in the poems variations around the glass of water no oh but yes yeah nessun dorma and bustle of the hour if you make a migraine from my finished and done and bustle yeah you can see the permutation in that point so it says it must be minus he doing the slaves now and can be the glass of water in my hands and doing my legs my my hands in the glass of water and my lips on you the glass of water in my lips and doing my hand my lips in my hands and you on the glass of water so these are words that means fermentation and there is a similar operation in with a rose also the cassava in this work the word rose or lawson spaniel place with its vibration and spanish so if you make up a ratio with rose you you can have you can have a little work and in spanish is rosa or was it no that can means a flower the roast but also that touch no roof or sad okay so i m going to finish here so as you can see there s a lot of information that has not yet been up but i want to rescue that possibility of having generating an order it this is an energy and also is important in the sense of woman here if you see all the presentation there is a movement and we did not intend to point a direct influence of the analytical help with the digital ones but with the with the one is a identify the similar patterns that electronic and digital convert into realization in the initial experiments so it s notinfluence is it s the patterns that are present in all the program for a particular edition so next is going to continue my good and we show you a map of the revision electronic and digital poetry a data visualization and also michael will explainour work because this mit media technology and genealogy is not a show in this is also to rescue and restore these pieces we have called this transcoding water and scope because when we rest we will when we restaurant we also create a modified everything at work and then finally at meals she s a researcher and also he s an artist and show us the last part of this genealogy what young people in peru is doing right now with digital poetry and electric electric poetry too thanks michael thanks okay sam iwant to speak in spanish sorry okay okay when a barista parte de la mesa boy you represented lays rock cafe the illness plateaus politico s esk where are you sarah largo the almost the stick with the manual when they

no one second okay hi my name is minister phonetic is a franca an art student specializing in painting of the quantity scenarios agatha dicaprio and these opportunity i will talk about my thesis project in which i will explain the concept that i ve been developing inthe name of the project is pulling that ip dot dot one dot one eight and it s where i seek to create an electronic hyper textual poetry visual and practice as an instrument of connection so the topic is starts from the electronic literature and focus on social networks connectivity and interaction between the writer and the reader as well as the interaction over poetry to recognize this poetry as well as as an action that tries to shapethe world and creates during the process nurturing the final product so for me that has changed as a result of these new interactions on the internet the approach and the means of communications as well there are moments in which the relevance of disconnection brings us closer when geography distance and time or space in us from each other and then a question comes up why don t we believe in our visual reformatted and electronic poetry and allow us to connect through hyperlinks when bodies are not no longer there i protect offers possibilities of keeping the community close as well as directly encouraging others to participate the goal is to allow the other to reflect to be encouraged to create changes from the point to establish an interaction and connection between the writer and the reader as i said before and consolidate reconciling or treat as a method with skills to modify reality here are some concepts and keywords from which i start to make the interplay and send this as a process as a reflection but also as a critique to the activism i got aor initiative of the reader to dive into the the reinterpretation of the poetry from the image as in the case of the hologram that s very seven cetera this reflection reflection convert on the languages by which i wanted to develop the project such as i believe web page video poetry the project main resource of circulation is the instagram account belinda in which there will be points using the resources proposed by electronically transfer every one of the points will speak from a personal and community view where the participation of the other is always relevant and the topics are extracted from the current situation such as corbett pandemic context and there is always the possibility of collaborative poetry so the file the process is kind of also the essence of the of my thesis and when in in when instagram interactions are used the most and one other external resources are utilized besides social networks the artistic part of its process will have a link whether acting to the website so the blue circle in the deployments as a wordplay among internet in ourselves and interdisciplinary and as they are points that deal with their context with particular at that point we read it as an as an action and interaction so there are seven employments on the resources as i said before now sharing material from users and my own creation the instagram stories and highlights stories are acts as a notification and also as i said before file and so the conclusion is that is that the intention of the process to be seen is for the constant inspection from others and the interaction that occurs between them so here the first employment is by month so i sorta it was work with google drive application in a word document and here is to let the other philly interact with the text the option to come in and edit inside a file it s always available and the general subject is the recent current time and virus and there s a static pattern the hyperlinks inside the boom which weather access either way to an image or a song or maybe another point the next one is in there by matt for gold editor and here comply videos which i personally saw as an avid the point blends with the image and sounds equates around inside reflects a private share unveil i asked the followers to share their own editor which with a video or a photo as a result all their video cole other additives was created the interaction here are the new are similar meanings now the other individuals decide to reveal the boys is enough that our peers are from some of my friends in order to generate less monotonous soi m going to show some of these interviews in the end and i just continue with the presentation and then i m going to show you some of them okay here in alabama say so as mr boom boom the sound of the words while being redone is what has the protectionism the sounders poetry s a new language that is created i use as mr as a sensory response in which the person feel satisfaction listeningto the sounds and again to make live to make the sound less monotonous i apply all their coats and language then it s a boy yet this seven processes the employment process of a form it uses vj by editor for its interpretation and presentation in a link and if they come from procedure or poetry you give them the machine variables and commands and it responds making the product okay the word cyber boom in which words are gravitating in a spot the instructions are not only in the instagram post but also on the same page assemble your point is the permanent suggestion to make the to make the drawing the curses is use the brush brush creates a live in mark where the phrase you are the point point which gives the user the possibility of being part of the action of the interpol okay in our in our buildings here the link sprayed another language directly from communication from whatsapp app which are something like telecom for example they are other links that are considered a strong ties in your social practices where we can jump from one reality toanother so images sounds awards this one is blend between the virtual unsentimental so there is no linear logic that allows us to perform only one way of portrayed a new conversation several these are conversations i asked three friends to make a short story in which we just play with words and images and songs the difference between our kind of normal conversations are the words will be involvedhere some of the parts of the conversation again i will show some of these are at the end okay dad is upset this in interpolate one nine um it was on video arts animation stop motion so it started with a conversation with the follower about the object that they are the best friends and i asked them to take a photo of the object and they kind of tell me the story behind it and why is important as a result of the conversation i create a point that also includes the keywords that they express the video i m sorry the posing questions following the video and the process the result and as well as the interaction is documented in the highlights stories so when i like kind of post these videos that i made i also asked the followers like what they think about the object that they have seen in that video and in which like they kind of react and make a choice of what is the object for them in order to make others assumptions and wait kind of haikus from their answers and this is also in the highlight stories so finally the last one is probably going to have five members of my family and friends to draw drawing on one with friends or something possible and the other two something impossible it may or not be it may or not may not be related to the current situation and on the other hand to write two sentences one related to your payment me life and another during the pandemic it didn t have to be related to your drawing we face in peru last november because of government i also choose to ask for opinions in one sentence for that means for sensitive people which is that age of means that luckily my sister was an admin so as a mother how they felt on the marches thechanges and the injustice that arose so i create a game in which the players tuesday matches the pictures and connect them with the sentences that i have to create using only the words that they have written to me with family friends and acquaintances this edited vs are hidden in the images such as we re here here and in this way is a kind of exclusive corpse that is created in which the boy is not only reading words but in pictures where a new random interplay was created every time they playedis kind of a performative act per se from the quality it s proposed to connect you writer with experienced from the others as well also the results that are share are in the highlights stories so here is like how it works what i m trying to generate with this interplay of myself feeling of belonging on behalf of the user and the tongue touching myself from the poem queda resistant to the situation that is handled from empathy and constant communication with the other if the user does not generate any interaction points not complete since their participation is expected to be part of the final product the creator for hypertext detaches himself from his own creation after providing the other with the path of spaces through which the text is director director but it s the reader for this is the path so as a tiny conclusion i actually consider this project is an open door for interdisciplinary teams between new languages of poetry itself as well as the different ways of creating images it s an initiative for personal development in the visual effects as well as for theothers will delve into these issues in the near future the belinda count exist to share and interact with viewers and at the same time extend what has been learned as an open dialogue by tree has a universal meaning and it s necessary to joining notonly with those who were involved in the matter but those who seek to understand themselves and their environment in a different way hopefully i will contribute to that course so now really really quick i want to show you some of these employments that are here i don t know if you can see my page i think you do if not tell mescream sorry so this one is the one that michael amber mill talked about which you can click here and there s a hyperlink there were there were sown in this case then this one it s called a retired in let s see cynthia tony clinical olivia leopard a sucker for uswith us nice brokers western system this one is from us i m just take a moment to wait a little to the target here are the other words that have been doing this one is they put a link below this is like a video in which i kind of show them how you can kind of read one of the possibilities of how you can read this and this one isgreater so you here first cause of disease and when you explain explain that this is an interplay of money you are part of the process and they you sell like like between two images like for example this and then you go and start and it gives you a kind of a collage and then you could show them and it shows you the boy i only use as i said before the words that they have give me given me and it kind of i don t know that s really fun doing this and this one i can well it was this one i don t know why he can enter i think i put it well sorry okay this one and that s i think that s it thank you as well so i left i have questions i wish we had more time
