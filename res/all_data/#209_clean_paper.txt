graduate student comparative studies in literature and culture lyr colin university of southern california hugging pixels how gaming rethinks physical interactions with a year of covid induced confinement everyone s lives have drastically changed they were obviously marked by loss mourning and pain carried by the spread of the infectious disease beyond that they were heavily affected in their most basic organization and articulation in an unprecedented way pre covid activities could easily be divided between inside and outside while that distinction could take different forms depending on each person s situation it seems nonetheless important to see that both work and leisure organized themselves around this understanding of space as a binary the space in which we have been confining ourselves could also be understood in terms of a different binary instead of an inside outside dichotomy it is now defined as online offline that is to say activities are determined by the capacity that we have to complete them over the internet or not e g remote work classes thanksgiving dinners ordering groceries dates etc this new binary thus forces us to consider our environment in terms of the real confined space we live in with the sense of isolation attached to it as opposed to the virtual of a new form of social life during a pandemic in enacting this spatial shift many have thus needed to adapt to a new life online one that is more deeply anchored in the virtual than it used to be in that sense i observed with some amusement my facebook friends complaining about a life where all leisure and social interaction had to be done online amusement because as a gamer that is my life and it has been for a long time before covid in this paper i want to look more closely at the ways in which social interactions occur online specifically in a gaming space i am more precisely interested in the ways in which physicality is enacted in a virtual gaming space in order to examine those issues i choose to start with a general discussion on physicality in itself and how it can be discussed in relation to media which are not meant to convey it i e audiovisual i will complete my argument with two different cases one is a discussion of massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs interactions more specifically final fantasy xiv which i approach both through the lens of my own personal experience playing it and through a discussion of the show dad of light as it makes use of the game itself in both its narrative and in its cinematography this part of my paper will center around the possible embodiment of an avatar and the ways in which said avatar communicates physicality back and forth with the player of an mmorpg my second case revolves around virtual reality vr and how physicality in that scenario compares my discussion around mmorpgs sensorial oxymorons in titling my paper i chose to go with a seemingly impossible action hugging pixels pixels after all are merely constitutive elements of a digital image they are intangible how could they possibly be touched or hugged in order to understand the oxymoron here i want to first define the virtual borrowing the definition from william r sherman and allan craig a virtual world is the content of a given medium it may solely exist in the mind of its originator or be broadcast in such a way that it can be shared with others a virtual world can exist without being displayed in a virtual reality system i e an integrated collection of hardware software and content assembled for producing virtual reality experiences much like play or film scripts exist independently of specific instances of their performance such scripts do in fact describe virtual worlds sherman craig we can thus argue that a virtual world or a virtual object is an idea which is conveyed to us through mediation as we cannot experience it in the raw of its originator s mind we have to rely on other elements such as scripts in order to approach them starting from this concept of the virtual as a mediated idea our mind is easily drawn to the most current forms of mediation writings drawings movies music etc in other words media that rely heavily if not exclusively on two of our senses sight and hearing from that understanding it becomes clearer that touch is often left aside when it comes to conveying the virtual we as consumers of narrative media typically have to engage with the diegesis through our sight and hearing yet our experience of audiovisual media is never exclusively tied to those two senses as is argued by laura marks in the skin of the film especially at a public movie theater sensory information of all sorts abounds we are aware of the movement and warmth of the other people in the theater as well as their whispered or shouted comments on the activity on screen or elsewhere smells of popcorn and all sorts of other food perfume cigarette smoke in the old days body odor cleaning products or mildew from musty theater seats any of these may address the sense of smell so insistently that it is hard to pay attention to the audiovisual image on screen in short the cinema viewing experience taken as a whole is already multisensory marks as marks argues the experience of going to the movie theater typically considered an audiovisual experience is never only about sight and hearing and it includes other senses such as the smells described here but also the tactile feeling of the theater s seat or even the taste of popcorn could be argued to be a part of the audiovisual experience itself all of these perceptions however non diegetic participate in the movie viewing experience and create an appropriate sensorial atmosphere marks s consideration of media thus goes beyond the object we typically consider the movie itself and englobes the environment and rituals of media consumption as part of the experience taking from marks we can thus argue that even in a massively audiovisual mediatic environment there can never be an experience that is deprived of other sensorial experiences in that sense touching the virtual becomes less about a sense of touch that has to do with a diegetic element but rather one that is tied to the experience of spectatorship as a whole in this perception of the act of the viewing the spectator is completely passive they are a sponge that soaks up their sensorial environment without necessarily engaging back with the media here film in front of them in that regard linda williams offers a different point of view in her essay film bodies gender genre and excess in which the viewer is not just acted upon but also reacts to the movie they are watching in the body genres i am isolating here however it seems to be the case that the success of these genres is often measured by the degree to which the audience sensation mimics what is seen on the screen whether this mimicry is exact e g whether the spectator at the porn film actually orgasms whether the spectator at the horror film actually shudders in fear whether the spectator of the melodrama actually dissolves in tears the success of these genres seems a self evident matter of measuring bodily response williams here we see that the viewer takes a more active role as they do not simply perceive their environment but act back at the medium in terms of a mimicry of what they perceive on screen their own bodies are thus influenced by the medium and the success of said mediatic object is even determined by the strength of the bodily reaction it provokes while my reading of marks proposed a distinction between senses interacting with the diegesis and senses interacting with the environment of the mediatic experience and therefore independent of the mediatic object williams lets us think of an experience that is mimetic almost synesthetic even when simply watching and or listening other senses can be actively solicited by the mediatic object it thus becomes more possible to consider an interaction with the virtual object even if only conveyed through audiovisual forms that also engages with the sense of touch hugging pixels the specific typically audiovisual medium that interests me in this paper is that of online video games a number of games do offer elements beyond the audiovisual the simple vibration of a controller upon a hit or in a tense cutscene is in fact a solicitation of the sense of touch yet the medium itself is broadly perceived as audiovisual and as offering little haptic i e tied to the sense of touch interaction what interests me here is less the examples in which there is a conscious attempt at a haptic gaming experience and more the ways in which given games already achieve a sense of bodily presence despite it not being their main design from my personal experience online gaming has always offered a richness of social interactions which i did not have in my immediate physical surrounding this manifested in the way of making friends from denmark portugal mexico or the united states all the way to singapore while remaining in my parisian apartment those interactions themselves are assuredly the reason why i can speak english to such an extent today and why i was able to transition to a life in the united states without feeling too violently uprooted my online friendships nonetheless puzzled people around me who wondered how friendship without any physical interaction or perspective thereof could possibly work if anything my friends were perceived as pen pals even though to me it felt like there was a physical component to hanging out with them on a near daily basis part of the reason why is because in a sense we were physically together not with our own bodies of flesh and blood but rather embodied by our game avatars in the specific context of mmorpgs game avatars are usually personalized and made the player s own by this process the player can create their own character as opposed to embodying a pre made protagonist e g geralt of rivia in the witcher series i would argue that customizing an avatar carries importance in the perception and articulation of the self as it allows to deconstruct an idea of a singular ego centered around our physical body and to replace it with a society of the self as articulated by sherry turkle in her article cyberspace and identity to use analyst philip bromberg s language online life has helped case learn how to stand in the spaces between selves and still feel one to see the multiplicity and still feel a unity to use computer scientist marvin minsky s phrase case feels at ease cycling through his society of mind a notion of identity as distributed and heterogeneous identity from the latin idem has been used habitually to refer to the sameness between two qualities on the internet however one can be many and one usually is turkle the avatar as a fragment of the self then is not simply a handy device but becomes an interface a medium in the same way that our own physical body acts as a medium between us and the real world the avatar is effectively our body inside a given virtual environment thus the process of character creation and naming can sometimes be confusing to someone who is not used to the idea of creating such an interface the show dad of light on netflix is based on a real story detailed in a japanese blog about the dad of light project in which a gamer introduced his year old father to the mmorpg final fantasy xiv while concealing his identity online it highlights important moments of the discovery of online gaming spaces starting with that of character creation in which the son helps his father to build a character the choice of an online name highlighted as comedic in the show is also an element of the real story recounted as follows 名前はどうする 実際の名前はあかんで しばらく考える父 しばらくのち ぼそりと じゃあ いのうえ え 誰 いやいや 世界を救う光の戦士の名前よ そんな近所にいそうな名 前でいいの 井上さん blog 光のお父さん what about your name you can t really use your real name dad thinks for a second and another and whispers hm then inoue huh who is that no no no is that the name of a warrior of light who saves the world is it really okay to have such a pedestrian name mr inoue translation mine the avatar from its very creation is problematized in terms of its need to be differentiated from reality it cannot be likely to be found in the neighborhood the literal translation of 近所 にいそう and needs to be demarcated from any sense of reality the need for a special name also highlights the fact that the father by attempting to name himself inoue a rather common name in japan had failed to embrace his entrance into a fantasy the definition of fantasy given by laplanche and pontalis is helpful in understanding the issue in his choice of name imaginary scene in which the subject is a protagonist representing the fulfilment of a wish in the last analysis an unconscious wish in a manner that is distorted to a greater or lesser extent by defensive processes laplanche pontalis by adopting a pedestrian name the father had utterly failed in embodying a protagonist in the words of his son is that the name of a warrior of light who saves the world here it seems thus essential to the integrity of the dad of light project that the father truly engages in the fantasy of the game as it will become the only way for a relationship to develop in the virtual space if the father fails to pour himself into his avatar and to achieve a sense of identification to the body on screen it then jeopardizes the project through which his son will be able to reach out through the use of this virtual space in that sense the in game avatars become vessels through which a relationship can express itself in ways that seem impossible to achieve in reality that is not to say of course that father and son in the case of the real story had a bad relationship to begin with rather the online interaction is envisioned as a way to develop something more something that is not only inexistent but seemingly unachievable in the real world as we see a scene of the father confronting a treant sapling a high level monster in the starting zone programmed to stay passive unless provoked the son immediately fears for his father s death and comes to his rescue as a response and not knowing how to use the chat function of the game the father instinctively does something that many players recognize he runs around the other player before leaving in a later scene which is a repeat of the same encounter the father will instead use the emote function and have his character kneel thus prompting nostalgic memories of the real life father kneeling in front of his son when he was a child these elements show what i want to call a disembodied physicality that is to say a physicality that is enacted without a tangible body but through the means of a virtual avatar although there is no direct physical interaction touching between the father and son s avatars there is nonetheless a physical element to their communication as the father uses his avatar s body to communicate his gratitude and emotions in a form of limited sign language this sense of disembodied physicality is precisely the feeling i described in the context of my own online gaming experience there is a specific quality to avatar interaction that simply cannot be found in text or vocal chat it is quite frequent when talking in game to end up meeting physically i e with each player s avatar with an interlocutor only to have one s avatar run around aimlessly while having a discussion there is no purpose to those actions in terms of the game itself however they serve a stronger sense of physical presence beyond that of a bodily sensation for the people involved hugging the air i have so far mentioned games that have if any a very limited sense of haptic interaction mmorpgs with the prevailing example of final fantasy xiv are games that are mostly audiovisual and not meant to stimulate any haptic sense in the player they were thus useful in exploring linda williams s idea of a media that elicits in an almost synesthetic way physical sensations without them being actually enacted upon the body in this part of my paper i want to turn to virtual reality vr games as a different system specifically in how they are designed to engage more senses and specifically touch than regular games in their discussion of vr sherman craig highlight different ways in which one can attempt to motivate the sense of touch through a gaming device such devices can make use of a player s joints i e making them move their arms legs fingers head etc apply a specific temperature texture or even electrical current at given moments limit movement in relation to either the body or to an object provide the player with an object of a specific shape that matches the diegetic item being held e g the guitar shaped controller to play guitar hero etc sherman craig in other words vr has many tools at its disposal to engage our haptic sense in more than a mimetic or synesthetic way an electrical current or a given texture or temperature will provoke a physical discomfort where linda williams s examples resulted from a process of identification or mimesis to the situation witnessed on screen in virtual reality embodiment is therefore fairly different from that observed in an mmorpg where a game like final fantasy xiv requires the player to disregard their physical body and project themselves onto an avatar as their vessel the vr system allows the player to directly use their own body and to transfer it to some capacity into the diegesis of the game itself it is therefore not a disembodied physicality as the body of flesh and blood is at the center of the gaming experience i want to bring up my own experience on a popular vr application vr chat in that game i have mostly interacted with a friend whom although i have yet to meet physically i am very close to we have interacted through instant text message voice only chat video chat mmorpgs and vr as i mentioned earlier there was already a qualitative difference between our interaction with and without avatars in terms of a feeling of closeness and disembodied physicality that we could share within the context of an mmorpg or other cooperative games with avatars this came to such an extent that upon first using video chat i already felt familiar with my friend s body language and facial expressions despite having only seen them in very few pictures before when using vr the way in which we interacted was further changed in mmorpgs there was a sense of wanting our avatars to be close to one another even though there was no such need to be able to communicate we simply wanted to see ourselves in our avatar embodiment replicate a natural situation of discussion while standing next to one another or at least being in relative physical proximity this was often accompanied by the use of emotes or other game elements to express ourselves for instance using a hug emote vr and specifically vr chat introduced a different perspective on those interactions in vr chat the proximity of avatars is a requirement for communication to the point that two players standing at opposite sides of a huge virtual room would not hear themselves well the game thus forces a sense of physical closeness and inertia that is close to what we experience in a real life conversation furthermore the use of emotes had to be supplanted by our actual gestures at times this means reaching out to one another or even awkwardly hugging the air glitching through each other s avatar the reason why i mention this experience is to bring up the fact that despite the apparent awkwardness of pretending to hug to high five or to poke one another we nonetheless did it and it brought a physical element to our interactions regardless of any actual haptic stimulus i want to think of this experience as one close to synesthesia the visual impression that we are hugging provoked a feeling satisfying enough that we were willing to engage in miming an actual act of physical interaction yet it seems quite different from more typically synesthetic experiences such as associating a musical note with a color despite not actually seeing anything here there is an actual physical engagement in the form of two halves of one hug each enacted physically by each player the association of senses is thus not purely mental but rooted in the willingness of the player to engage in a one sided act of physical interaction which is only reciprocated in terms of a visual stimulus for this sentiment i would propose a neologism phantesthesia that is to say a ghost phantasma sensation aisthesis of physical interaction despite the fact that the subject is engaging into a physical act on their own hugging the air or reaching out towards something that one can see but not feel becomes akin to attempting to embrace an illusion or a specter it is there for one sense yet not for the other but we choose to engage with it with all our senses nonetheless using the concepts of disembodied physicality and phantesthesia side by side i hope to obtain a better understanding of how physicality can be articulated in virtual spaces depending on the means at hand this consideration would lead me to consider the extent to which as players we engage ourselves with the game s diegesis and end up becoming a part of the virtual world itself works cited gaylor graham and jesse joudrey vr chat video game
