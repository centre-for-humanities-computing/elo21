can lead to just one more snippet or they can lead to more than one the reader thus constructs the line of events by choosing where to go next when presented with more than one option text snippets can have multiple incoming links and multipleoutgoinglinks readingitinerariescanleadtocertainsnippetsmorethanonce thus each reading constructs a specific narrative through specific choices at these hypertextual intersections any individual itinerary will likely lead to some intersection snippets more than once which gives the reader the possibility to explore the other paths ignored before at the sametime thenumberofsnippetsislargeenoughthattheoverallstructureofthetextisrather difficult to deduce from following more and different itineraries the text adresses the reader explicitly in several reflexive passages where a choice leads to a snippet that starts with a comment of that choice or musings about the motivation of the reader passing by a specific intersection several times during one itinerary through the text also reflects on the narrative structure and the constructive function of the reader and their reading it points out the contingency of a certain choice and with each different route a reader explores they sketch atraceintotheirmemory whichmightleadtoamapofthestory shouldthatsketchbewritten down the textual and narrative structure of zeit für die bombe can be approached both from the perspective of the itinerary experience and from the perspective of the overall structure that canbededucedbymappingalloptionsofferedbythetext modelingnetworksofnetliterature and interpreting these networks of net works needs to take into account both perspectives and not confuse the network topology data and visualization with a stable version of an otherwise dynamic object at the same time the network structure of a literary text can provideresearchapproacheswithspecificinsightsandhelpnavigatethetext the surge of web archives and the need for analytics approaches in recent years have led to the development of frameworks that provide functions for the extraction of reference information from warc files notably the archives unleashed toolkit lin et al and linkgate eldakarandalsabbagh bothframeworksextractreferenceinformationfrom the warc header references that were not written into the warc header at crawl time are lost both frameworks provide functions for large scale analytics where efficiency is a major factor for our research on net literature we need detailed representations of reference networks in this scenario best outcome meaning the software catching all references that exist in a warc file is more important than computing efficiency our software module warc graph provides multiple methods for analyzing warc header and

additional browsing contexts so called nested browsing contexts w c html when working with a network visualization it is helpful to be able to see in the graph how many browsing contexts the work contains or spawns and which resources will be displayed in which browsing context the problem of nested browsing contexts is rather complex with the current version of our software module browsing

live web can be passed allowing analysis of websites ontheliveweb the library warc graph for use in python environments or programs provides the principal function create_model that needs a path to a warc file as input this function returns a directed graph that is implemented with the open source library networkx hagberg et al this means that networkx can then be used for further computation e g

tool iterates over all the entries in this file using the warcio library all the html files are then analysed using three different extraction methods the most basic approach reads out the metadata stored in the warc file usually all the outlinks found at crawling will be stored here this method is quite robust and performant but it lacks flexibility domains can be filtered but what was not found in the crawling process can also not be analysed now to make matters worse storing the outlinks is not defined as a requirement in the warc specification quality and scopethusdependsonthetoolsusedforcrawlingandarchiving in our second approach we analyse the html data using the python library beautifulsoup richardson all tags contained in the html data can be found

passingalistoftuplestothe create_networkfunction nextsteps we have used warc graph successfully for an exploration into non linear text structures and non linear narrative in specific works of net literature from the dla corpus in order to make the approach more robust we hope to expand the scope of our tests to other web archive corpora do a more in depth assessment of existing warc analytics frameworks and better define the specific function warc graph can fulfill in web archive analytics workflows furthermore the transformation of warc files into graph representations opens up archival and research possibilities on a corpus level we will explore the possibilities of such graph representations for further analytical questions pertaining not only to references but also to the content of the elements or nodes of each object and of different aggregations up to the level of large web archives this approach also requires epistemological and aesthetic reflections on graph
