distributed memories compuserve s gamer s forum and the halcyon days of the adventure game toolkit judith pintar university of illinois at urbana champaign a few years ago i took my children then young teenagers to the strong museum of play in rochester new york a wonderland of interactive exhibits and games in one room dozens of brightly lit and flashing pinball machines invited us to play our fill but my son soon wandered away i found him in an unflashy corner of the next room over sitting in front of a boxy computer monitor playing a late s version of the largely text based oregon trail he sat at that computer far longer than the time he spent on anything else in the whole museum which perplexed me it is a game that he had many times played as a child both at school and at home the museum seemed to have triggered in him an experience of nostalgic immersion as can happens when we read a book we associate with an earlier period in our lives the emotions don t necessarily arise from a sentimental attachment to the trigger itself oregon trail was never his favorite game so what was going on virtual worlds emerge from and occur inside of what gamers prosaically refer to as real life rl affective attachments to virtual communities or game worlds are never fully disconnected from rl professional personal cultural social and sociotechnical experiences pleasures and anxieties when my son re entered the virtual world of oregon trail it wasn t just that fictional digital world he was revisiting he had also been connected with his past self who he was in our family in school and in his own younger game playing skin maybe he was recalling past mishaps and errors and trying to evade them with benefit of hindsight and his new intellectually mature gamer s vantage but maybe he was just having fun and the rest was unconscious whatever the case i m glad i didn t wreck his flow experience just because i was curious about his choice in the research report following the multi institution study preserving virtual worlds jerome mcdonough and his colleagues at the university of illinois maryland institute of technology rochester institute of technology and stanford university made the argument that what we must preserve when we set out to collect archive and curate games is not just the software and the hardware necessary to play them but the worlds that they create they understand virtual game worlds to be simultaneously artifacts commodities and communities as such the problem of preservation necessitates attention to sociotechnical legal and relational issues simultaneously mcdonough as artifacts for example the issue of hardware and software obsolescence makes it difficult to ensure that collected games can continue to be played as commodities games constitute intellectual property protected by copyright law though it can be difficult to determine ownership in order to acquire permission the digital millennium copyright act prohibits attempts to circumvent the anti copying measures that games instituted in their original form as well as the development of emulation technology how does one preserve and curate a game that is one is not legally entitled to play legal and illegal emulations as well as rom hacking editing produce new game worlds which may be close copies distortions parodies or completely unique works that rest upon the framework of an old one some employ intellectual property in ways that fall into areas of fair use but some don t which such versions of any game should be collected preserved and curated copying that can t be done legally frequently proceeds illegally and not all such activities will end up in court institutional archives have to step carefully when they enter the fray preserving the third aspect of virtual worlds the community part may appear less problematic generations of ethnographic work has demonstrated how relationally rich virtual worlds can be see for example taylor boellsdorff et all pellicone ahn loss is inevitable game worlds do die one of the sections in the virtual worlds report is called virtual worlds that died during the grant once a virtual world is gone studies of its artifacts commodities and communities necessarily become forensic kirschenbaum eschewing the crime scene metaphor digital artifacts can be understood as objects turned up archeological sites they need to be studied in relationship to the stratum in which they were found see huhtamo and parikka context is needed to understand what the lived experience of a lost world once was i think about such tasks as restorative first of provenance and then of meaning i will soon be launching a restorative project related to the virtual world of the pre internet era bbs compuserve cis cis gamer s forum was a virtual community within that virtual world in the late s and early s writers and players of interactive fiction text based and other types of games and to a lesser extent experimental and electronic literatures all paid by the minute for the privilege of spending time together in cis gamer s forum cis did little if any archiving of its forums in the period before when it was sold to america online aol its chief market rival which was experienced as a bitter betrayal by some of its users the user generated digital content of the cis forums during the bbs era the collective memories of those communities have been lost in time like tears in rain one might be tempted to say but not completely in pre internet dial up era users had to pay twice first for the cost of the phone call and then in a fee to the bbs service for time spent online it cost a significant amount of money to hang out on compuserve and users found a variety of strategies to reduce the cost chief among these was the tactic of fetching online content and reading it offline software add on product emerged to automate the retrieval of new mail and messages this can be understood as a kind of sociotechnical drift the most popular of such applications was the access program for the compuserve information service known as tapcis written in borland s turbo pascal by howard banner tapcis allowed cis users not only to quickly download content but also to peruse the indexes of forum libraries and the transcripts of private chats and public conferences offline tapcis was the user experience tool of choice of compuserve system operators sysops both paid staff and volunteer moderators who received free flags that allowed them to spend long periods of time online without cost surviving the takeover by aol tapcis lingered almost unbelievably long as a beloved interface until its farewell announcement is sweet and was clearly penned with tears we all knew long ago when the online world started moving away from proprietary systems to the web that our tapcis days were numbered nobody then ever could have dreamed that we would have lasted even as long as we have it s been a wonderful wacky marvelous run and we have loved every minute of it the use of apps like tapcis and other time saving strategies users employed to defy the fiduciary realities of virtual worlds as commodity provided a serendipitous benefit they inadvertently produced a distributed archive of digital artifacts they are significantly endangered stored in thousands of wet basements in boxes of sorted and unsorted floppy disks or somewhat more securely but just as obscurely on the backup tapes and cds upon which the contents of floppy disks were copied if such digital artifacts can be found and collected they could restore much of the digital architecture of cis gamer s forum the failure of compuserve to archive its content was not only sad for its users but it was also self defeating in a historical sense in his blog dedicated to the pre internet era the digital antiquarian jimmy maher points out that compuserve remains largely unrecognized as the influence it was in the development of the internet in histories of these things the focus always goes to the early arpanet the invention of tcp ip etc which is important incredibly important but a huge part of contemporary online culture can t actually be traced back to the arpanet and early internet it was compuserve that invented and or popularized real time chat e commerce online travel reservations online newspapers online encyclopedias much of online gaming etc etc few people seem to remember that my goal in restoring cis gamer s forum is not to restore cis to its rightful place in history i m still mad about the aol thing i m interested in preserving the digital artifacts of the post infocom pre inform era of interactive faction the period in which the adventure game toolkit agt was at center stage written in pascal by david malmberg agt was inspired by and a significant revision and extension of the generic adventure game system gags created by mark j welch in the mid s i wrote my first interactive fiction in gags which was installed on a used computer that i bought in boulder colorado in the late s a pc s unlimited xt which chugged along at a blisteringly fast mhz its turbo mode which could be turned off at need i used gags so continuously that honesty compelled me to register it i sent off the suggested fee to welch and received back a letter from malmberg with disks of agt software documentation and games i was blown away by what i could create using these new tools during the early s as i worked was a children s theater director and artist in residence in various santa cruz california public schools staging students original plays and teaching them to write text adventures using agt the development system requires no coding so it was a wonderful tool to teach the kids to write interactive stories agt does not require any coding per se though it teaches logical procedural and ontological thinking designers create three text files which the agt compiler processes into a game or other type of interactive story the first a dat file contains a long list of rooms objects and creatures including humans indexed with a number the location of an object at start of play for example will reference the number of a particular room attributes of these game items like what room is to the north or whether an object is edible are also recorded in this file the second a msg file is a long list of texts also indexed with a number including everything that might be printed to the screen in response to player action or error the correspondence between the dat entries and the msg entries was always easy for the students to grasp the description of an object contained in the dat file is referenced by the number of the appropriate text in the msg file they are essentially two linked databases more challenging for kids was the cmd file in which the initial values of all variables used in the game both number and boolean variables are set and additional verbs the commands that the player can use during play are defined the rest of the cmd file is given over to what malmberg called meta commands these define what will happen depending on what a player types under a variety of conditions what room the player is in what the player is carrying the value of certain variables in various combinations whether an item is edible and so on the system is simple and intuitive and no programming experience or perceived aptitude or cultural capital or computer savvy was necessary to make interactive stories using agt for my young students likely for this reason in part during the late eighties and early nineties it was the system of choice for non programmers wanting to create parser based interactive stories welch held an interactive fiction competition in for games written in gags after his acquisition and revision of gags malmberg re launched the competition in as an agt competition one of my games cosmoserve an adventure game for the bbs enslaved won the agt contest it was both a parody and a simulation of cis the work s player character is a hapless programmer named a j wright whose program written in turborf pascal a software product created by orfland a nod to borland s turbo pascal is not compiling this is a problem since delivery is expected the next day the scenes that take place in the r j wright s house read and play like traditional text adventures the player has to go south open fridge put tv dinner in microwave and so on but once the player turns on the computer the screen is taken over by what looks like a dos environment and only dos commands are recognized by the game there are a couple of programs that appear to run from dos including a pascal compiler that crashes and throws an error message a word processing program loosely based on wordstar and a working draft of a gags game being developed by the player character a game inside the game the player will need to evade such distractions however and log on to a simulated compuserve bbs called cosmoserve via a dos dial up program in order to really get started with the game once the player logs on cosmoserve looks much as cis did in the early s with forums libraries message boards live conferences the player must download a patch for the misbehaving pascal to finish their program this won t be so easy since every download contains a virus and the orfland rep will deny that the problem is on their end meanwhile the player s attention wanders due to rumors of a ghost in the machine the majority of the game is played by doing the ordinary tasks of the old compuserve virtual world attempting to download files from forum libraries without transmission errors being spammed by strangers resisting invitations for hot chat and trying not to run up too high of a credit card bill trying to your programming job done the illusion that players logged into cosmoserve were somehow actually online was often reported to me i used the computer speaker to simulate the classic modem noise and i incorporated the familiar system beeps sometimes people who registered the game would tell me that when a virus attacked their simulated computer and they ran chkdsk in the simulated dos environment and it reported file corruption they felt heart pounding fear that my game had destroyed their actual computer player distress was never my intent but i am pleased in retrospect cosmoserve is a simulacrum a kind of preservation that allows its players to glimpse a world that is gone i m not referring only to the online experience of cis but the rl world of dial up modems money worries over spending too much time online and the fear of downloading viruses as well as the silly and stereotypical but not completely inaccurate experiences of pizza eating sleep deprived programmers during the era when dos was boss and borland ruled the programming world i certainly never anticipated what would thirty years on be the hardest puzzle in the game how to change a directory at a dos prompt maher has noted regarding agt and other early games in the post infocom world that have been derided as hobbyist games that to a much greater degree than the games of infocom and other commercial publishers agt games feel like particularly personal expressions of their creators in later years jokes and no small amount of scoffing would be attached to everyone s first game which inevitably begins in said person s bedroom and proceeds to play out in an environment interesting and meaningful to absolutely no one beyond the author s friends and family yet the same tendency that spawns that phenomenon constitutes i think an important part of the text adventure s ongoing fascination the fact that the first impulse of someone being given the ability to create an interactive narrative is to simulate their own lives is intriguing to me it is true that every semester a hefty percentage of my students upon being given the power to create any narrative world they can think of do painstaking recreate their path from their own bed to their bathroom i don t think that s what s going on in the early agt games however consider two winners of the agt contest a dudley dilemma which told a story about a phd student at harvard was written by lane barrow when he was a phd student at harvard son of stagefright a story set in a community theater was written by mike mccauley who was well acquainted with that small culture rather than being a sign of the narrative weakness of early games maher sees something else in those autobiographic esque works when we look back today to the agt games of decades ago they take on an additional layer of interest as historical documents in their own right of the times and places that spawned them i agree with maher that what is valuable about these early agt games and the half written beginnings of games that early agt users also have buried in their basements that i will invite them to unearth is that many of these early games recorded the rl context in which they were writing cosmoserve was intentionally not game like in many ways because i was trying to point out that cis users played it like a game just as a dudley dilemma allows players to experience harvard in the late eighties and early nineties and son of stagefright lets players glimpse community theater in that era cosmoserve allows players to experience what it felt like to dial up and spend time in cis within a decent degree of accuracy given the technical limits of agt a certain amount of trolling of agt happened much of it coming from partisans of its competitors centered on the limitations of the system which was not meant to be a programming language when cosmoserve came out a rumor went round that i had hacked agt to accomplish it it is true that i tweaked the pascal source code and recompiled it but most of what i did was to accommodate the size of my games which were infocom length i penned a defense of agt that ran in xyzzy the interactive fiction rag of the day in which i attributed the perceived limitations to developer laziness i largely stand by that defense which arises from my love of constrained art forms nobody hates on a haiku because they only have syllables when i teach interactive narrative design constraint of various kinds is presented as an essential source of inspiration the year after i wrote cosmoserve i organized the seven person team of cis gamer s forum members who together wrote the agt game shades of gray an adventure in black and white soggy which won the agt competition in a special co authored category it was a game about moral ambiguity and i can t say more without spoilers i mention it here because both of my games are surviving artifacts of the creative and generative virtual world of the cis gamer s forum the soggy team was given a free flag to use when we were working on the game this was an unprecedented privilege in the forum a decision made by some higher cis powers which engendered some resentment but which made the endeavor possible in and i served as a judge for those last two years of the agt competition which by then had begun to accept games written in platforms other than agt like text adventure development system tads written by michael j roberts which had its own fiercely loyal community and is still in active use today in the mid s malmberg announced that he would no longer be maintaining agt because it didn t grow with the needs of its users it was left behind by other tools which were responsive to the community i don t blame malmberg for this his company softworks which he created to support agt was never a commercial success and the work of supporting it was largely solo and thankless for years i felt guilty that i didn t take responsibility for agt at that point since i was more publicly associated with it than anyone but malmberg but the rl world was changing around agt in the charismatic ceo of borland philippe kahn resigned and missteps in its choices shifted it out of the spotlight and in cis sold itself to aol the rl and virtual world gestalt that cosmoserve had simulated was gone of course cis gamers forum was far from being the only interactive narrative community of the era if my if world was disappearing around me others flowed together and coalesced around the interactive fiction competition ifcomp it began in picking up the torch as the agt competition let it fall this was the time that inform a language written by graham nelson began its rise in its current incarnation as inform is the most important development language in the parser based interactive fiction world and ifcomp is the longest running interactive narrative design competition the competition and the ifdb an archive of interactive fiction created and maintained by tads creator michael roberts are both now supported by volunteers in the non profit interactive fiction technology foundation iftf i write if and other interactive narratives in inform now having learned it by translating cosmoserve into its natural language code through that process i came to understand that the narrative of the game exists separately from its coded instructions it is neither both an agt game and an inform game but it remains tied to the history of agt as a creative agent in the bbs era to borland before its fall and to the rl world from which cis gamer s forum emerged that virtual world does still breathe or at least appears to breathe through cosmoserve but simulation is not really preservation by calling for a gathering of the distributed memories of gamer s forum including particularly people s unfinished agt games i hope to crowdsource the collecting of the digital artifacts of those entwined virtual worlds now lost i went hunting for my tapcis files which i knew had to be in my cache of floppy disks that i could somehow never bring myself throw away even after i no longer had a machine that could access them such is the liminal state in which cis gamer s forum and agt artifacts everywhere exist i discovered that i possess digital records holding the memories of my conversations with people who knew me on gamer s forum as teela brown the luckiest woman in the world heh i don t know most of their rl names either i have found transcripts of private chats and public conferences giving testimony to our experiences as readers and writers of interactive fiction of gamers and game designers in that brief bbs era some of what i have found speaks to the gaming and game writing lives of women in what was a conspicuously male dominated game world treasures i thought that cis gamer s forum was lost when cis failed to preserve its digital history it turns out that it miraculously survives in
