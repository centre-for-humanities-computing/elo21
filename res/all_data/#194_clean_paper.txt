platforming inclusivity blaseball and an inclusive vision of browser games on march th celebrities deaths tweeted out an obituary for the recently deceased raúl leal the loss of raul sic leal is a devastating blow for miamiblaseball sic the linked obituary tells us raul was a beautiful boy who feared no umpire feared no incineration and protected his team with his life while it is not clear who this teammate was why they might fear an umpire or what horrifying incident led them to being incinerated a savvy reader would quickly notice references to blaseball in the summer of amidst the pandemic we still ﬁnd ourselves in the grip of los angeles based studio the game band released blaseball a browser based baseball simulator that combined the quintessential american sport with the darkly comical eldritch horror seen in recent years in works such as the podcast welcome to nightvale the game is notable for its impassioned fanbase who have latched onto the game and engage with it on a variety of online platforms in the case of raúl leal s obituary game developer and critic cat manning notes that e nough people tweeted about raúl s death that an algorithmically driven obituary generating site reported on it as though a real person had died while celebrities deaths is not the ﬁrst exploitative twitter bot to be foiled by an enthusiastic audience a much more prominent example would be the design stealing bots that were trolled in later by canny artists the fact that the chatter around raúl leal s death was intense enough to meet an algorithmic deﬁnition of a celebrity death speaks to the passionate and public engagement that fans have with blaseball deathsnews raúl leal catacalypto ramos a curious aspect about blaseball is that despite the shared passion fans have for the game the experience that gamers have when engaging with the game is surprisingly heterogenous while some gamers will engage deeply with the stats that the site throws out while teams compete others are primarily interested in the personas that the community develops for each player still more gamers may ﬁnd themselves interested less in the game itself and more in some of the epitexts blaseball also stands alone in the developers support for a breadth of interpretations not just of the meaning of the work but also of ﬁne grained details right down to the descriptions of the players on the teams the developers want fast to be empowered by the creative potential of blaseball while also ensuring no one gets shut out by others personal interpretations the game band help achieve this by employing a minimalist text forward interface providing fans with api access to read the statistics and establishing a community policy of not revealing information found through the api without ﬂagging it as such the community has adopted the spirit of collaboration fostered by the game band most notably by developing new technologies for the game s fan wiki that build multiple interpretations into the fabric of the site by leveraging these aspects of the technological underpinnings of the game both the game band and the fans themselves have developed an inclusive environment where fans are welcome to enjoy the game on their own terms and have tools at their disposal to help facilitate that enjoyment without stepping on another fan s toes when trying to understand the complicated interactions between gamers with different interests and different expectations of play it s helpful to ﬁnd some kind of framework or a point of comparison as i considered this problem my mind kept turning to mia consalvo s work on cheating in her analysis of cheating consalvo notes that players can be divided into different groups based on how they understand the concept of cheating ranging from players who see it as something entirely beyond the pale to players who see cheating as nothing more than part of the ecosystem of gaming a note on terms normally the people who play a game would be referred to as players but blaseball can make this somewhat confusing because the in game characters are themselves players with this potential for confusion in mind i am calling the in game characters players teammates or characters depending on context and am calling the real world people who participate in the cultural event of blaseball fans or gamers also depending on context greszes consalvo it can be easy to see cheating as a zero sum game where cheaters and non cheaters are put into strict opposition with no middle ground but consalvo s study reveals greater nuance than that even within the strictest conception of cheating there is a great deal of room for play and for the same activities that might be considered cheating in one context would be deemed acceptable if frowned upon in another for example while players may frown upon someone who asks for help from a friend they might accept it if the player had already tried to ﬁgure out the situation on their own ﬁrst and tell the player that they re only cheating themselves cheating is a relational activity and so any analysis of it must speak to a broader network of players i must note some caution at this point i don t think that members of the blaseball community are cheating when they engage with the game in different ways but rather that this model of community behaviour transfers well and can reveal important patterns of behaviour consalvo demonstrates that the concept of cheating is built on both technological and social interactions that go against the grain of what a player is expected to do in a way that confers an advantage and that p layers actively make ethical judgments about gameplay that extended beyond the coded rules of the game with consalvo s work in mind i want to look at the technical and social components that create the space for multiple styles of play to coexist harmoniously without the animosity or sense of zero sum play that characterise gaming communities plagued by cheating blaseball s platform is ultimately fundamental to the inclusive model of gaming that the game band developed and gamers extended the centrality of browsers to inclusiveness is visible in many elements of the game from the ability of stats oriented gamers to explore forbidden knowledge without spoiling the fun of others to the colourful personas fans have developed for the players and the ability for contradictory personas to coexist peacefully in the community much of blaseball s inclusiveness is tied to the way the game is presented through the fan s web browser unlike many games blaseball features only a handful of graphical assets and much of what appears at ﬁrst glance to be graphical elements such as the teams logos are actually emoji and therefore textual in nature most importantly the players themselves are entirely textual fans can only see the player s name and a handful of statistics there are no markers of gender age or ethnicity in the game aside from what fans might infer from a player s name and even in that case clear indicators of these attributes are notably lacking while a name like isaac johnson may imply gender and a vague sense of ethnicity one look at johnson s ibid ibid teammates should sow doubt how conﬁdent can we feel in our assumptions about johnson when the chicago fireﬁghters lineup also includes justice spoon socks maybe swamuel mora and baby triumphant the use of text and the evocative names encourages fans to imagine a diverse universe of players with few limits on what a player might be fans have responded enthusiastically and have crafted a variety of personas to match the names that include players of a variety of ages genders sexual orientations and even species the public data on each player leaves room for these interpretations without contradiction when dealing with web content however it is important to remember that a site s code is only ever hiding just beneath the surface because blaseball is a browser based game any fan can simply view the game s source to see what is happening behind the scenes there is a wealth of information available to fans interested in exploring this data and the game band have facilitated these explorations by making an api available to the fans the information itself breaks down into information that is publicly available such as player names team names the current score and other such statistics as well as information that is not publicly available this latter category includes a variety of statistics some with known effects on the game and some without including attributes such as moxie totalfingers shakespearianism buoyancy anticapitalism and evolution fans can use their web browser s source viewer to investigate the technological underpinnings of the game and to discover the information fans can discover through using the api causes a problem for an inclusive game while analysing this the blaseball api reveals a wealth of information about the teams and players above the statistics for core mechanics player polkadot patterson reveals cryptic statistics such as anticapitalism and laserlikeness it is worth noting that attributes that would contradict fan interpretations of players are absent entirely gender sexual orientation age ethnicity and other such attributes simply do not exist canonically information is a great deal of fun for those of us who enjoy peeking behind the curtain to see how everything runs for other fans knowing this information can dispel some of the magic from the game the zero sum nature of this knowledge means that in order to preserve the ability for both styles of play spoiled and unspoiled to coexist inclusively there must be some kind of system to allow players who enjoy being spoiled to view this data without introducing it to players who prefer to enjoy the game unspoiled the platform itself provides some measure of protection accessing the api requires concerted non trivial effort and even if a fan were to access it accidentally say by clicking an api link posted to a forum they would ﬁnd an impenetrable wall of text that for the most part would reveal no secrets without additional processing teams players and other components of the game are represented by universally unique identiﬁers uuids each of which is a bit randomly generated number composed of a series of hexadecimal digits that due to the sheer quantity of numbers involved is all but guaranteed to be unique due to the length and variability of these numbers a fan is highly unlikely to be able to memorise them and would certainly not be able to recognise one at a glance and as such a player seeing a list of uuids will not be spoiled until they have cross referenced the ids and produced a list that matches information across several api queries the use of uuids then rather than a more transparent identiﬁer scheme helps preserve a separations between different types of fan engagement visiting https www blaseball com database allteams technically gives fans a glimpse of much of the inner workings of the teams but most of the information is a collection of impenetrable uuids of course the technical measures the game band employ with the api are only useful up to the point that a fan has assembled all the data and connected stats to players from that point on sharing the compiled information can expose other fans to secrets and inner workings that they may wish to remain ignorant of to guard against this the game band and fans have developed the concept of forbidden knowledge which the blaseball wiki deﬁnes as is a subset of information about blaseball that we would consider canonical but is considered signiﬁcantly spoiler heavy in any context more explicitly forbidden knowledge is the leach help forbidden knowledge underlying structure and algorithmic makeup of the game and simulation that is hidden from public view as opposed to information and mechanics visible on blaseball com as a social system of signposting the concept of forbidden knowledge ﬁts well with consalvo s understanding of attitudes towards cheating as existing on a continuum on the one end where consalvo identiﬁes the purist who believ es that anything other than a solo effort in completing a game is cheating we can see an analogue to players who loathe the idea of encountering anything beyond information that s completely public on the other end of the continuum consalvo identiﬁes players who see cheating as wrong only if it degrades another s experience and may even participate in cheating for the pleasures it can bring an attitude that we can see in the society for internet blaseball research sibr a group that delights in digging into the hidden information in the game and producing deep analyses of the game s statistics flagging forbidden knowledge allows both the purists and sibr to coexist happily as each group can make an informed choice and enjoy their preferred style of play without degrading the other s experience blaseball fans themselves have also been instrumental in using the affordances of the web platform itself to create spaces where multiple visions of the game can coexist without one or the other dominating the rest this is especially apparent when examining how players have resolved the potential for friction between versions of the players themselves which can differ greatly depending on the writer or artist behind a particular version because as discussed above there is very little canonical information on players that deﬁnes their physical features fans are free to assign their own preferences to each individual player and no fan will ever ﬁnd that their own vision for the player is contradicted in the available data furthermore because what little physical data there is on players ﬁngers being the most obvious is considered forbidden knowledge it is highly unlikely to factor into fans visions of the characters ultimately any sense that there is a true form of a player is suspended indeﬁnitely ibid consalvo ibid two different visions of the popular jaylen hotdogﬁngers player appear in the first edition collection of tlopps blaseball cards and instead each version coexists with every other version free from worry that an ofﬁcial proclamation will ever render it obsolete or even secondary perhaps the best example of the indeﬁnitely suspended form of a blaseball player is pitching machine who originally joined the lineup of the unlimited tacos in season after the tacos fans conspired to have the team s entire pitching roster rendered unable to play while the only description the game provides of pitching machine is the name fans quickly ﬁlled out the details and began to craft a persona for the new pitcher while the obvious interpretation of pitching machine is the mechanical ball throwing device used by players to practice their batting blaseball fans delight in ﬁnding oblique interpretations of the game given blaseball s naming conventions philippa warr writes pitching machine could be someone s legit name or it could be a robot with a blood collection the two options warr proposes are reﬂected in some of the many interpretations fans came up with for the player a regular pitching machine wearing a cap a frankenstein like assemblage a humanoid robot and a largely human appearing character although the diverse conceptions of pitching machine are largely irreconcilable the blaseball community has developed a solution to allow each of these visions of the character to coexist the developers of the blaseball wiki created a feature known as the interdimensional rumour mill irm which is a system of wiki extensions that allows for contributors to offer their unique interpretations of blaseball players without invalidating any preexisting or future interpretations because the wiki is a webpage the content being served to users can be changed each time the page is loaded and so the irm will show the reader a randomly selected interpretation each time the page is reloaded this system places all of the pitching machine philippawar hetreasky skele bells sparksel occultclassic help interdimensional rumor mill guide ibid interpretations on even footing and allows fans to encounter each interpretation with the same level of respect and gravitas as the next another element that helps disrupt the sense that there might be an implied hierarchy or a preferred interpretation is the interdimensional frequency number or if similarly to the uuids discussed above and unlike a serial number which would imply some sense of order or chronology the if number is randomly generated with the possibility of being overridden for narrative purposes and is described by the wiki s administrators as being a sort of radio station tuning to a speciﬁc dimension where your rumor lives this analogy underscores the degree to which these interpretations are a matter of taste if a fan doesn t like what they re hearing they can simply tune in to another station the irm and the if numbers demonstrate well the ways in which the affordances of the web can support diverse visions of a game websites like the blaseball wiki can draw from a deep well of interpretations giving fans an opportunity to contribute their own voice to the conversation and know that at least some of the time it will be the voice that other fans hear by paying attention to the subtle hierarchies that can be established by serial numbers thoughtful developers can develop numbering systems like uuids or if numbers that offer gamers a non hierarchical classiﬁcation system that nonetheless works seamlessly with the requirements of modern web technologies as the above examples show between clever design that makes the most of the technological affordances of websites and the careful development of community expectations it is possible for fans of a game to enjoy it in a number of radically different and even mutually exclusive ways without ever jeopardising another fan s ability to enjoy the game while blaseball is aided by a fanbase that at least for now does not have a segment of fans that goes out of its way to grief the other segments it nonetheless shows the potential for other web based games to foster such an agreeable and diverse community just as cheating must be understood at the intersection of technological exploits and social practices so too must inclusive design where the former must be understood so developers can prevent one group from ruining the fun of others the latter must be understood so that developers can support all groups in their unique approaches to enjoying the game ibid ibid
