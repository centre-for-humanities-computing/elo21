dystopic plagiarized platforms found text corrupted code and robotic poetics abstract the auto biography of 김정은 is a conceptual found artwork in vii parts it combines found code with found text multiple found computational pieces have been modified with vocabulary drawn from multiple speeches delivered by the current north korean leader kim jong un 김정은 in addition vocabulary and phrases from journalism critical of the north korean regime are also incorporated into these generative works on the one hand this work is an experiment in propaganda delivery it emulates the relentlessness of the north korean indoctrination machine and shows how born digital writing can be stolen and misused in so doing it reveals digital literature s power as part of this process a kim jong un poetic robot has been created to demonstrate how such propaganda might be delivered forced upon a populace this work also seeks to capture the perspective of a curious intelligent yet powerless north korean citizen and demonstrate how they might struggle to engage with local culture this paper reflects on this artwork in relation to critical code studies marino specifically it looks at how code can be adopted and exploited through practice led research smith and dean this work deliberately exploits the code of multiple digital poets in order to show how such works might be corrupted these subsequent works can be regarded as an example of third generation electronic literature flores these works can also be regarded as an example of overt plagiarism holland batt and jeffery if the works fictional construction is believed then it would be an example of covert plagiarism additionally this paper looks at how this code and corrupted poetry could be reformed into robotic poetics winder through this extension to robotic poetics this paper extends the notion of critical code studies by extending it to robotics and interrogating what impact such an artefact has on transforming the initial work key words robotic poetics dystopia overt plagiarism found text code studies the auto biography of 김정은 is a conceptual found artwork in vii parts it combines found code with found text multiple found computational pieces have been modified with vocabulary drawn from multiple speeches delivered by the current north korean leader kim jong un 김정은 in addition vocabulary and phrases from journalism critical of the north korean regime has also been incorporated into these generative works this work represents a dystopic platform on the one hand this work is an experiment in propaganda delivery it emulates the relentlessness of the north korean indoctrination machine and shows how born digital writing can be stolen and misused in so doing it reveals digital literature s power as part of this process with the input and assistance of canadian industrial automation specialist brett griffin and griffin prototyping a kim jong un poetic robot was created to demonstrate how such propaganda might be delivered forced upon a populace this paper reflects on this artwork specifically in relation to how code can be adopted and exploited in addition to exploring hypothetical propaganda platforms this project also seeks to capture the perspective of a curious intelligent yet powerless north korean citizen and demonstrate how they might struggle to engage with local culture the work can be regarded as an example of overt plagiarism holland batt and jeffery though within the diegetic world of the piece the smaller works would be regarded as covert plagiarism similarly the broader work as a whole would be regarded as an example of second generation electronic literature while the smaller works within the diegetic world of the work could be regarded as examples of third generation electronic literature flores additionally this paper looks at how code and corrupted poetry can be reformed into robotic poetics winder and possibilities through an examination of this extension to robotics this paper further interrogates what impact such an artefact has on transforming the initial code the initial inspiration for this work was to corrupt existing digital literature using the perspective and vocabulary of a totalitarian force six digital poetic works from the publication taper an online literary magazine for small computational pieces were chosen for the pool players at the golden shovel by lillian yvonne bertram us by nick montfort if jupiter had turned into a star by everest pipkin thermodynamics by sebastian bartlett rise by angela chang and by eugenio tisselli works from taper were chosen for two reasons firstly the code of works published in taper is free to use and open source secondly taper s submissions have clearly defined set parameters works must not use any external libraries or apis nor link to any external resources including fonts and the works must not exceed more than kb bytes therefore these works allowed for a level of similarity that would allow the reader to consistently compare the impact on the various individual works the vocabulary in these computational works was replaced with vocabulary taken from north korean propaganda and works critical of the north korean regime part i uses text of a speech delivered by kim jong un at the military parade held in celebration of the th founding anniversary of the kpa as reported and translated by the korean central news agency and north korea no liberty humour irony no love by christopher hitchens part ii uses vocabulary taken from text of a speech delivered by kim jong un at the grand banquet hosted by xi jinping at the great hall of the people on march as reported and translated by the korean central news agency and the aquariums of pyongyang ten years in the north korean gulag by kang chol hwan and pierre rigoulot part iii uses phrases taken from kim jong un s new year address and north korea everything you need to know about the country by the bbc part iv uses vocabulary taken from the joint statement of president donald j trump of the united states of america and chairman kim jong un of the democratic people s republic of korea at the singapore summit and when north korea falls by robert d kaplan part v uses phrases taken from the panmunjeom declaration for peace prosperity and unification of the korean peninsula and tall storey north korea s infamous hotel of doom to open shortly maybe by justin mccurry part vi takes vocabulary from the feats performed by the great victors will remain for ever and kim jong un has quietly built a man cyber army that gives north korea an edge nuclear weapons don t by ellen ioanes this paper project is an example of practice led research practice led research is defined by smith and dean as an activity which can appear in a variety of guises across the spectrum of practice and research it can be basic research carried out independent of creative work though it may be subsequently applied to it research conducted in the process of shaping an artwork or research which is the documentation theorisation and contextualisation of an artwork and the process of making it by its creator this research then is a combination of all three of smith and dean s definitions smith and dean continue to argue that the term practice led research and its affiliates practice based research practice as research are used to make two arguments about practice first the creative work in itself is a form of research and generates detectable research outputs the work can also be regarded as a work of overt plagiarism holland batt and the second argument suggests that creative practice can lead to specialised research insights this paper then is an example of smith and dean s second argument in that it highlights the insights conceptualisation and theorisation which can arise when artists reflect on and document their own creative practice jeffery the concept of found poetry such as the cento as explored by the dadaists and surrealists and more recently in works by american conceptual poet kenneth goldsmith who regards poetry as an act of uncreative writing or curation and transcription could be applied to this work within the diegetic world of the broader work however the code utilised could be regarded as covert plagiarism covert plagiarism is defined as works that attempt to conceal theft for example graham nunn s platypus uses scaffolded plagiarism to covertly plagiarise helen dunmore s heron passmore though nunn later argued that he was performing a work of overt plagiarism the lack of acknowledgement in the initial publication suggests otherwise similarly the use of code by the fictional north korean propagandists the work imagines would most certainly go unacknowledged the auto biography of 김정은can also be regarded as an example of second generation electronic literature that contains third generation work the second generation of electronic literature flores argues begins in with the web this generation consists of innovative works created with custom interfaces and forms this generation continues into the present the third generation flores proposes starts around these digital works use established platforms with massive user bases such as social media networks apps mobile and touchscreen devices and web api services this generation coexists with the second the auto biography of 김정은 as a whole should be regarded as a second generation work of electronic literature contained within the work however are numerous shorter works that repurpose digital works from taper in and of themselves these works would be regarded as third generation electronic literature in digital literary practices code should be regarded as a meta authority that denotes authority to specific components of the work the auto biography of 김정은 confirms this proposal while the code of any work of electronic literature has the authority to denote power to the media fragments within the work it does not have authority in and of itself in critical code studies marino writes in my paper collaboration and authority in electronic literature i argued that but the code is not enough in itself it is crucial to explore context who wrote the code when and why in what language was the code written what programming paradigm was used was it written for a particular platform hardware or software how did the code change over time what material or social constraints impacted the creation of this code how does this code respond to the context in which it was created how was the code received by others my italics these latter italicised questions are of interest in this work i have proposed that a fictional north korean propagandist has within the social constraints of dprk appropriated this code through this work which filters critical works of the dprk into dprk propaganda i have also attempted to create what the experience may be like for an intelligent yet powerless north korean citizen and show how they might fail to engage with local culture firstly the vocabulary is made up predominantly of propaganda but it also contains comparatively smaller amounts of vocabulary drawn from works critical of north korea the final digital products therefore contain traces of criticism but it is never potent enough to be persuasive yet beyond this vocabulary there is also the retained code of the taper works part of this practice led research s purpose is to develop a work to test whether or not the poetics of the code itself communicated something fundamental that is perhaps in conflict with the intentions of the north korean propaganda certainly none of the creators of the original taper works are north korean propagandists it is therefore perhaps also important to disclose my own relationship to the dprk on a personal level i have some experience with north korea as a lecturer at tsinghua university in beijing china i taught a handful of privileged north korean students i have journeyed to pyongyang north korea with a british filmmaking company where i engaged with a number of very privileged north koreans and have cautiously discussed these topics with north koreans working in beijing the penultimate question posed by marino how does this code respond to the context in which it was created however indicates that in creating and engaging with the auto biography of 김정은 one must also read it as a product of neoliberalism the freedom to create the work in and of itself as a faux propaganda piece is as much a product of contemporary neoliberalist culture and as such provides insights into my culture as much if not more so than the dprk s propaganda network and its impact on its citizenry propaganda is by no means exclusively practiced by totalitarian beyond these generational works a robotic kim jong un was created to read the regimes this project therefore encourages readers to reflect on how any platform can be co opted and exploited for propagandistic means generational works this emulated a potential propaganda device similar to the radios installed in north korean homes whose volume can be turned down but never off robotic poetics theorist winder writes there is a fundamental link between language and robots whatever material constitution they may have arms and legs cogs and wheels and engines the crucial ingredients the ones that separate robots from wrenches are their instructions instructions are perhaps inscribed in some concrete medium but they are quintessentially abstract existing more in the netherworld of code than in concrete form that code netherworld is where humans and robots inevitably meet it is where humans are most robotic and where robots are most human winder defines robotic poetics as the study of robotic authors and the automatic generation of creative texts going further winder defines future interwoven problematics that concern robotic poetics mechanization combinatory virtualization and abstraction towards metastructures these generative works produce new content at the same time they are very much delimited and it is this delimitation that is exploited by the fictional north korean creator of the auto biography of 김정은 practice led research is such that the creative interrogation often raises more questions than it answers for now it appears that on the question of whether or not works of electronic literature offer a perfect propaganda platform waiting to be exploited dystopic or a fundamental artistic impulse that is retained despite potentially nefarious amendments utopic it is likely not an either or but a spectrum i am left feeling much like a curious yet powerless north korean citizen unsure of what the future of such platforms will be yet i remain alert constantly listening for the feint traces of truth works cited flores l third generation electronic literature electronic book
