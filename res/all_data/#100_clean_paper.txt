today digital technology not only helps it s users in every walk of life to address human limitations but also to control and direct their ideologies hence the novel concept of advanced transhumanism is prevalent this study sought to explore the possibilities of conducting researches in the field of human language and digital technology amidst related fields the article presents theoretical concepts and methodological tools from multimodal analysis that allow the readers to gain new insights into the study of electronic literature and the difference between a monomodal and multimodal children literature the data for this article comes from grimm brothers transcribed tale named little red riding hood directly from fairy tale narrated by their villagers and the digital novel redridinghood from the st collection of electronic literature the discussion and analysis part of the project explains that how various modes can be used to convey the underlying meanings clearly and create a single masterpiece which is suggested as a new form of literature since the definition of literature does not match with this innovative form the article suggests that it should be revised and look over again which says that literature is anything written in an artistic form of human expressions in an organized manner but as for as a multimodal piece of work is concerned it is a combination of distinct mono modal structures as sounds visual images spatial and textual evidences these all modes are shown in redridinghood specifically and the other literary works in the st collection of electronic literature in general since in pakistan the investigations in this field are rare so it provides the basis for future studies in the field of human language and digital technology and other above mentioned v related areas also this research can opens up the new ways for the immersive literacy and for the researchers to focus on the innovative immersive literacy its need impacts social consequences and other possible transformations it requires for the born digital generation keywords multimodal analysis monomodal text electronic literature modes khurshid sarwet introduction digital technology proffers innovative activities that lead its users to the new man movement it helps them to find new ways of getting knowledge digital literature comes up after the remarkable changes in digital technology the students of language and literature must be intelligent enough to adopt new approaches in literature not because new genres are comprehending the complexity of the real world but because of their power to look at the world with more assertiveness and to present its readers as they are not outdated creatures electronic literature organization elo published a definition of e literature as it refers to as a kind of literature that is made digitally and is intended to be observed digitally katherine hayles pointed out that electronic literature is generally appeared to exclude the digitalized form of print literature thus a literary piece of work that is originally in print form but is changed into an e book can t be called a work of e literature difference between print and electronic literature a piece of e literature is completely different from the print based text because it joins a number of digital elements such as portable icons and digital sounds etc together with the written text where portability is more likely to generate an interactive involvement of the viewer or the reader this novel form of literature is referred to as more flexible non linear and more intricate which presents the viewers choices of being interactive the environment of reading has become slightly different after the remarkable alterations in digital technology now a moveable screen within a screen is going to articulate a story in such a manner that the viewers can hear an untold depiction via visual expressions this notion is breaking the traditional cycle to consider a written piece of work by using your imagination powers and then comprehend it in your own level of understanding so the notions that the transformation in literature from print to electronic raised various doubts which are obvious to rational minds these questions also endorse many areas for further study what is the need and purpose of literature why does literature always enjoy the status of being transformed into various modifications are these modifications really advantageous for the readers what sort of alterations a fresh reader will khurshid sarwet notice when he moves from print to the electronic library what are the advantages and disadvantages of e literature does pleasure reading still exist can this innovative kind of literature be termed as a form where the death of the author is definite about the story red riding hood the data for the present study comes from leishman s digital story redridinghood first published in in electronic literature organization elo included this flash piece in its first publication of electronic literature collection st volume out of three elo volumes which according to them is an edited anthology of electronic literature and to support the notion of redridinghood grimm brothers transcribed tale named little red riding hood directly from fairy tale narrated by their villagers has also been selected the visionary landscape redridinghood is actually a playful retelling of a famous piece of children literature which suggests the possibility for the multifarious form of collaborative storytelling beyond written text significance of the study the findings and results of the present study will be beneficial to society as electronic literature is a novel and widely growing genre of literature so it is crucial for the born digital generation to comprehend the benefits of multimodal texts and how new modes are applied in the construction of electronic literature multimodality research focus this research will be focusing on the problem of multimodality in visual landscapes which contains semiotic triggers and explore the ways through which a multimodal analysis of the digital images is possible the varying notions of literature will be explored after the semiotic analysis of two contrary versions of a similar story this research will elaborate on the symbolic meanings of symbols presented by distinctive modes that are used in the creation of redridinghood khurshid sarwet research questions following are the research questions is there a possibility to understand the story redridinghood e literature as the readers understand the written version of little red riding hood in the past which of the semiotic multimodal elements triggers involved in the construction of both versions of redridinghood what are the possible interpretations of the story redridinghood after analyzing it through the concept of multimodality are the different modes that are presented in the story redridinghood e literature conveying the meaning clearly khurshid sarwet literature review the review of the related literature endeavors to explore and discuss the past literature in the field of human language and digital technology along with the well known theories of discourse as multimodal analysis applied on the contemporaneous interactive multimodal fictional pieces the term transhumanism was first used in huxley s work new bottles for new wine where transhumanism had been termed as an evolutionary humanism in which the digital natives transcended themselves to an extent that now they are addressing their problems by gaining knowledge through new ways as technology has transformed human life these days in the present study a similar notion is tried to be presented where the literature is becoming more entertaining when non linearity multimodality and users interactivity are added up into a monomodal and linear piece of literature alyousef sheds light on the fact that no published study has analyzed and explored the composition and thematic progression which is equally contributing to the development of a well formed meaningful digital text therefore he worked mainly on the logico semantic and multimodal textual features in his multimodal discourse analysis alyousef similarly in the present study the textual and the non textual have been discussed and given importance for the construction of the better electronic literature piece and the users understandability humanity plus is an international organization that promotes a positive image and the use of digital technology to augment human abilities again the term transhumanist is preferred by the respondents in a research conducted by hughes the secretary of the world transhumaninst association the confidence level of the organization remained high which makes the notion clear about transhumanism because advanced technology is there to raise human conditions and is appreciated greatly by the techno optimists hughes the notion of multimodality came from halliday s conception of metafunctions matthiessen halliday in which it is claimed that language focus on three main metafunctions called ideational written textual and interpersonal functions kress and leeuwen have observed the similar metafunctions and term them as interactive compositional and representational to them the visual like all semiotic modes has to serve khurshid sarwet several communicational and representational requirements to fulfill the communicational requirements in his work forceville extends multimodality studies by kress and van leeuwen and how they focused on alteration from monomodal to the multimodal texts cyber text actually makes the readers the viewers in cybernetics wiener has coined the term cybertext where a text is shown as a machine and a screen within a screen is seen in another work walsh draws our attention towards how other literary theories respond to the shift in literature from print to electronic to interactivity also learning methods are getting changed in digital natives from those of digital immigrants prensky in her work alexandra milyaina expounds on the variations in literature and shifts our attention towards the struggles the modern schools are making to achieve the status of applicable deterioration in reading inspiration here the promptness the term suggested in multimodality is describing the quest for a considerable shift in consideration for the print material to read as little red riding hood to endure the novel variations like interactive multimodal fiction or an electronic piece of literature such as leishman s redridinghood khurshid sarwet introduction to research methodology and analytical framework since the present study deals with the presentation and examination of different versions of red riding hood the proposed method along with the analytical framework applied on the study are discussed in this section method and methodology of the study the research methodology comprises some of the important aspects such as the objective of the study data analysis technique and method of research a objective of the study the objective of the study is to understand the new genre of literature to comprehend it according to its electronic literature requirements and to accept and recognize the variations in the literature by analyzing the piece of work redridinghood from the st collection of electronic literature through using a multimodal analysis b method of research the method that is used is the qualitative method the research describes and analyzes redridinghood by leishman based on the relationship between various modes that have been used in the literary work and assumes the representations subjectively as the writer s interpretations through the modes also the print version named little red riding hood by grimm brothers has also been examined to support the main argument c data analysis technique in this research the descriptive analysis technique is used first of all the researcher classified and carefully sorted the data out after the close classification of the collected data the researcher compiled data into distinct modes the various modes in which the data is compiled khurshid sarwet has many forms such as sounds visual images spatial gestural elements aids and textual evidence etc after the compilation of data into these modes the researcher then relates these modes to each other to find out the appropriate meaning or message by using the multimodal theory d instrument of the research the instruments of the research are the researchers themselves by using content investigation and close observation to realize the variations in literature from print literature to the online screen version the analytical model of the study a multimodal discourse analysis gunther kress and theo van leeuwen the prominent figures of the theory referred as multimodal discourse analysis van leeuwen kress a collection of two or more multimodal or semiotic systems which are approximately five in number helps in the creation of a multimodal script in this story visual and audio such as portable and still images and music or sounds gestural and spatial aids are dominating over the textual elements aids such as written ad spoken text here the given below model is employed as a theoretical framework for data presentation and analysis of the present study figure dimensions of multimodal discourse analysis khurshid sarwet the structure for the presentation and analysis of the selected data is clearly demarcated in the adapted model given above in the figure where two categories named textual features as narrative style and written text and non textual features as users interactivity visuals still and portable visuals and music or the sounds are given separately in the next level the findings of textual and non textual modes and discussed collectively under the heading of the collective findings section to generalize the results on digital readers as a whole khurshid sarwet introduction to presentation and data analysis of the textual and non textual features used in red riding hood redridinghood by leishman is a tale from the first collection of electronic literature which aims to define what electronic literature is and how we labeled this collection as an emergent genre of literature this research tries to find its position in the already existing literature such as the selected fairy tale little red riding hood and will suggest new ways to analyze a literary piece of work through using the same methods and theories which will delineate the essentiality of multi modes in the preexisting literature the data presented here is going through various stages of analysis going from general intermediate to the micro level of analysis in the story first the linguistic or the textual features modes are examined carefully the non textual modes have been investigated thenceforth there are several modes elements are contributing to creating a single artifact narrative style in red riding hood both the story types fall in the category of fictional literature if the narrative style to be observed carefully however the piece of e literature bears a more realistic approach and presents some of the real life settings behaviors and events that are set as jumping off points for the narration of the story than those presented in the print version of red riding hood the exposition of little red riding hood presents the depiction of a little girl with a red cap named red is living with her mother and is meeting with a wolf in the jungle there the conflict begins after that the falling action comes when the wolf is chased off then comes the resolution part where the downfall of the antagonist wolf has been presented on the other hand in the electronic literature version redridinghood the story has been narrated more into a new adult fiction genre where the protagonist seems in the first visual presentation as one who struggles for her personal choices after that she possesses to be sexually attracted by the wolf like human etc the story has been narrated without using any textual or spoken features but the non linguistic features such as moveable images interactivity and sounds etc also the instructions for using the electronic literature are mentioned in the beginning that there is no text in the entire story there is a soundtrack played in the background and visual images in the form of animatronics are the main sources to build an understanding of the tale the term coined for this comprehension is khurshid sarwet multiliteracy the comprehension via distinct modes of communication which bears the inclusion of images sounds and colors rather than a written text only the use of multiple modes to impart a complex understanding of the primary themes of the story best characterizes this multimodal digital fiction as the master narrative or the realist image gustafsson hagström thus the main dissimilarity can be noticed or estimated intelligibly by the user that all applied l modes are active side by side aim to disclose the predominant storyline that constructs and permeates the creators and developers intended meaning including the low altitude narratives like red s physical appearance her mother home description and the color selection to make the viewers more imaginative yet precise about the master narrative the written text in red riding hood the selected electronic piece redridinghood is delineated to be based on non textual modes yet better comprehending the master narrative and the underlying notion behind the construction whereas grimm brothers print version of little red riding hood is entirely revolving around a single feature that is written text the rectilinear linearity makes it possible in the mono modal version of literature to lead towards the ambiguities and can be considered differently than the authors intended message moving the readers towards the modern anthologies it is crucial to accept the modern ways to convey the literature either in the form of playing and viewing or reading it however this seems absent in the print version of red riding hood where red the protagonist is described only by calling her dear little girl and the description is given why is she called little red riding hood comparing to the written tale redridinghood never uses the written chunks but the choice of red color everywhere brings the users to the point that they collectively agree to call the little girl as little red riding hood again the european fairy tale tells the readers as having zero control over changing the written and then printed form of the story but in the electronic literature version tries to follow the rule of reader as author by asking the users to select the story and the only written extracts are used in the story are the options such as shall red dream and wake her up this diversity of options broadens the users perceptions and builds the complex ideologies by non linear artistic perspectives it is also said that playing and viewing art and literature avoid confusions for the students more than the mere written piece of work the reader response khurshid sarwet theory is standing on the same point that it is not known that how the text is going to impact you and how the author wants to conceive it between how is it dissimilar to your world of reality visuals in the story red riding hood a picture is worth a thousand words a visual portable or a still image is able to deliver very profoundly the intended meaning of any conceptualization more than a plain written or verbal description the current inquiry has given the selected still and portable visuals including photographs and drawings from the electronic piece of literature redridinghood as the print version is based only on the static written text this visual presentation and its investigation intelligibly define the importance and advantage of the shift in literature particularly the portability of visuals the first selected visual for multimodal analysis is displayed at the top of the screen and the icon confirms that red is the combination of both east and west because she resembles as a colored girl with yellow hair but surprisingly her hazel eyes with rebellious black eyebrows are grabbing the ample consideration of viewers because the color of one s eyes in this case is green curious about nature passionate and also refers to a jealous person might reveal much more about the soul and personality and narrates a vivid depiction of ambiguous realities of the contemporary world without any typographic text this first image actually conveys a clear narration of red s life and choices how is she living and what her mother is asking for these all are told in the first representation khurshid sarwet figure selected visuals of red her mother and the wolf from the story redridinghood music or sounds in red riding hood amid visuals music or the sound play is the only mode that has been working throughout the series amidst other non textual and textual modes such as written images and the written text in the electronic version of red riding hood the particular mode can be observed where the ordinary still images shift to the movable animation corpora where the viewer is required to move and without his effort to be active the story has no supremacy enough to express the next happening the next the melody sounds emanate with distinctive shades of red color in the new icon after that the screen breaks the silence and a jazzy soundtrack expedites the story and assists in the progress of narratives because the emergence of new modes digital literature is having an insightful consequence on how we create construct and even reconstruct the meaning and faded away from the centuries long ascendency of writing via words it gives way to an innovative dominance is about permission to enable adobe flash player level then at once khurshid sarwet hence is mentioned as visual images and narration is possible and the level is achieved through trial and errors in current times the supremacy of artworks images led to an increased awareness in exploring the visual fabrication literacy and erudition through visual aids and essentially the sounds and the music the new medium is not restricted only to visual modes to communicate and interact but the interdisciplinary nature of work allows the reader the viewer to experience electronic literature to get more understandability about e literature learning let s say with oral modes virtual reality narratives such as spoken words e g in video games and soundtracks e g in red ridinghood according to kress and van leeuwen almost at the end of every scene it comes to exultant yet meaningful closures where both the relaxing and activating music can be heard in the background in the visual experience each individual has a chance to turn the sounds off e g in the beginning red s ear produces a sound like an image with a mark of a tick and cross but by attempting to do so one must find the images as dull and dreary portable graphic animations kress and leeuwen s method of multimodal analysis reveals and supports this notion that sounds in the particular work escalates the desire to transport towards the intricate interplay so it is not an incorrect conception that every single mode is playing an equal amount in the construction the use of narrative media sounds guides the audiences prophecy in this case viewers as well both literally as well as figuratively although in this story the sounds are played in a completely linear pattern which is not always supposed to provide aid to the audiences addressees recognition and the realization of different sequential happenings in the story but the contribution of appropriate music for the narrative structure in silent animation is not dubious and players occasionally ensure their actions fit with the musical dramatic context users interactivity in the red riding hood the users interactivity can be described as one of the most significant strategies to characterize the overlap and divergence of electronic literature from that of print versions of storytelling the audience s valuation and understandability come via constant decision making as being interactive while experiencing this novel kind of literature the only mode that departs khurshid sarwet its fiction from that of digitized or print version little red riding hood is the digital interactivity the work redridinghood is termed interactive multimodal fiction where the experiencer performs certain actions to proceed the story further this distinctive attribute of digital literature is best described by confucius i hear and i forget i see and i remember i do and i understand cashman et al this shows a willing attitude towards performativity and by this he also delineates the limitations of literature in print and the verbal activities used to tell a story in ancient times when there is an involvement in doing an act the chances of comprehension are also increasing this is the case with electronic literature but confucius quote unveiled the basic characteristics very tactfully and we can interpret it by saying that electronic literature redridinghood is a kind of literature which involves the characteristics of the already accepted form of literature as well as introduces a new medium which is interactive narration it is more an artistic snapshot than a cultural study collective findings of textual and non textual modes in red riding hood a combination of two or more semiotic multimodal systems which are roughly five in number makes a multimodal script in this story audio visual and gestural elements aids are dominating over the textual linguistic and spatial modes it is useful to elucidate theoretical discussion with the concrete example from the targeted work where in the second image the book image with three and a half lines are shown as written which is in an imaginative cloud comes clearly from red s mouth and is a vibrant portrayal that the protagonist herself is a narrator of the story inside the frame it contains three contradictory shades of red color red is used universally to signify danger e g sounds also signify that something atrocious and horrendous is about to happen adoration lust and is linked with sexual desires perhaps the entire atmosphere is red only because of the protagonist name red in this image a letter r with black dye has appeared which holds an emblematic association and also communicates about the character on which a viewer must have a curiosity to explore strong elements in her personality e g spiritual and psychological letters in astrology and numerology draw attention to itself because of the multiplicity of important features and themes it treats in this letter according to penny on whackowitch astrology describes the impacts properties and possessions related to the names that begin with the particular letter the eighteenth letter of the alphabet which stands for khurshid sarwet results and the learning from the experience from the result this accounts back to red s experience of being rebellious and recalcitrant endeavors which lead her end route for a throbbing culmination the paramount protagonist of any fictitious work is the foremost foundation for the narrative construction and thus is more reminiscent than any other persona how to encounter with discombobulated designs and without lexia there must be a strong narrative enigma still in some icons there is an awareness because of multimodal methods to find a treasured individual as well as the evilest character the antagonist a man s looks gestures and attire defines his personality no an individual s characterization is imaginable merely through his recital performance but it is the talent of reader or viewer to poise themselves in the construction of a character as the protagonist or an antagonist whether not being prosperous enough to find the overt portrayal they strangely able to uncover the character according to their personal and private insight which is customarily factual and veracious this is obvious when in the fourth frame because in digital literature operations are measured as more vital than literary narrative so the audience have to label on their own to discern the visuals judiciously that the wolf s character is a garbed upright and virtuous or deceptive evil and most erroneous creature on the face of earth yes there are few clues attached to his character since the very beginning e g a green animal like creature traces the girl but are not clear enough for such audience who have not experienced yet from hundreds of little red riding hood tale collections the printed text version entertains the bibliophiles by announcing the optimistic or undesirable personality via textual evidence in an initial stage except for those mysterious and cagy ones who are mostly less in number but still exist but here interaction is at its peak and somewhat miscalculated because the character like the bad boy wolf can be interpreted as an appealing and happy go lucky one in an initial stage with his yellow pants and wheeling in the above explanation background effective composition is traced as an endowment of aid to achieve a convinced accomplishment which is connected to the authors ache for a specific supposition the real problem starts when the stimulus e g connotation is confused with the response e g association but the chosen method is bias in favor of possible interpretations of viewers because the connotation is the aspect of the product created by authors and an association is the property of experiencer electronic literature seems to maintain this distinction khurshid sarwet but it does not move beyond this preservation that without implementing of personal suggestions or associations gathered from beliefs norms ethnicity and cultural experiences the connotations from authors cannot be understood accurately the addendum should not be disregarded and overlooked in this respect so a third lens is important to make the experiencers certain about the author s connotation so the task is accomplished through having close analytical observation as this study did and replayed again and again to reach at the final conclusion every interactive fiction depends upon a fiction of interaction stuart moulthrop interactive narrative actually is in redridinghood this can be easily interpreted via hyperfictional narratives as present in the case of redridinghood yet a complex domain is attached along with it interactivity here should not be taken as a confusing phenomenon where the phrase reader as a writer is predominantly occurs which should be swapped with reader as the costoryteller the question then arises that what the storyline setting e g red s apartment and grandmother s house etc characters e g red her mother her grandmother and monster like man presumably a wolf etc and plot e g the context of the story and red s emotional experiences with dissimilar circumstances etc is created entirely through the authors but the user experiences an exceptional way of exploration because he can add his own intentionality to the original product that is the interaction in the fantasy or imaginative world here to witness her daydream is certainly an optimal decision among both options as shall red dream and wake her up to take the decision that the ball is on audience s court by asking a rhetorical question and request afterward for creating a new connotation that you the experiencers are the only source to construe the story in accordance with your own tenacity for the character in the dream section red with a modern look adolescence but also senses her future menace by looking at the revolving baby same as the evil character her way is again filled with crosses which recommend her not to enter in a far away empty cage like house this symbolic portion is going to be the turning point of red s life and her painful journey towards a terrible end where she awakens but not being able to change the bitter reality there are certain symbolic elements offered to the experiencers for their complete understandability for instance the initial letter of girl s name with the lowercase letter which can not be an omission rather the intentional use describes red s subordinate or subservient position in the story and can be considered it a foreshadowing that she will lose her innocence further khurshid sarwet findings and conclusion of the study this part covers all the major findings the study contains and the focal point of the investigation it carefully presents the entire conception of the work offered in the initial stage for the electronic literature developers digital learners and in general the digital natives it also presents how successfully the proposed aims are achieved that are discussed hypothetically in the beginning with regard to practice literature is anything written the analysis of the study underscores the importance of electronic literature in this digital age which clearly establishes its place in the literature of its own thus there is no ambivalence to introduce e lit as an emerging genre of literature since the definition of literature does not match with this innovative form it should be revised and look over again which says that in an artistic form of human expressions in an organized manner yet this traditional definition is missing something as for as a multimodal piece of work is concerned it is a combination of distinct monomodal structures as sounds visual images spatial and textual pieces of evidence these all are present in redridinghood specifically and other literary works in the st collection of electronic literature in general hence the general definition of literature needs to be modified or refined to include the multimodal works as a novel version of literature this study provides the contemporary genre of literature that suits the needs of digital natives as interactivity and experiencers choices are considered reverential thus they owe to practice it according to their own selections expertise khurshid sarwet directions for further studies the current study has been completed by pakistani researchers where past researches in the specific field are not available commonly it opens up the new paths for the immersive literacy since it is not common in remote areas of pakistan and for the investigators to observe the innovative immersive literacy its impacts need and the social consequences along with other manageable transformations that are required for the digital natives or the born digital generation for future studies on the present research work it is recommended that various other models can be applied to the electronic literature to view other aspects which are not discussed in the present study moreover a larger sample can be taken comprising more than one piece of electronic literature redridinghood to prove the current hypothesis the theories previously used to analyze the traditional way of writing a piece of literature can be applied to the emerging genre of literature which is termed as electronic literature the narrative of the electronic literature can be enhanced by the addition of language forms making it far more under narratology rather than ludology khurshid sarwet references kress
