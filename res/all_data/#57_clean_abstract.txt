 the forced confinement due to the covid pandemic has been framed as a condition from which to reassess modern life s habits and values and build upon such reassessment in order to reimagine a more sustainable and equitable future a ubiquitous feature of such confinement has been the transition from physical presential modes of expression and interaction to virtual ones typically supported through electronic platforms in the current conditions of physical distancing and confinement electronic platform culture presents a tension between two opposite but coexisting aspects isolation and connectedness both of which it seems to amplify the former through its implication of physical distance the latter through its global reach my poster will offer a reflection on today s recourse to electronic platforms under conditions of physical confinement in light of physiological evidence and philosophical ideas in particular the work of ancient chinese thinker zhuang zhou bc a prominent feature of zhuang zhou s thought is the emphasis on contemplation and spontaneity as vehicles for the achievement of virtue and wisdom in his writings zhuang zhou maintains that the perfect man does nothing in the hope of attaining by contemplation a like spontaneity zhuang zhou s emphasis on wisdom as spontaneity as opposed to deliberate action echoes aristotle s bc account of virtue as acquired through automatic habit as opposed to wilful effort similarly zhuang zhou s emphasis on spontaneity and automaticity resonates with the prominent role of involuntary mechanisms in human physiology as in the autonomic nervous system which ensures human survival through unconscious automatic processes zhuang zhou s stress on the link between virtue and spontaneity continues to be relevant today as its emphasis on the pursuit of contemplation and inactivity challenges the intuitive understanding of the human individual as defined by conscious deliberate and wilful choices and highlights instead the centrality of unconscious non deliberate and automatic physiological mechanisms that largely regulate human survival furthermore zhuang zhou s emphasis on the pursuit of contemplation and inactivity as the path to wisdom resonates with sections of the rhetoric permeating the discourse around the current pandemic related forced confinement building on my dual training in literature and neuroscience i will elo bring zhuang zhou s theory of spontaneity and inactivity into dialogue with physiological mechanisms as they relate to the use of electronic platforms under conditions of confinement by pitting zhuang zhou s intuitions against aristotle s theory and today s state of affairs my poster will use the current pandemic related platform based culture as a pivot to draw conceptual bridges between ideas spanning millennia and continents this confrontation will also prompt reflection on ways in which the specific circumstances of the current pandemic affected the production of and the cultural practices surrounding electronic literature as well as how literature may in turn orientate the ways in which the specific circumstances of the pandemic are framed and experienced my goal is offer a tradition rooted yet timely and forward looking reflection that might prompt fresh utopian and perhaps also dystopian perspectives on the world s current predicament
