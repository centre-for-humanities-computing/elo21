stockholm university sweden mirjam dsv su se glasgow school of art uk s louchart gsa ac uk abstract the design and study of interactive digital narratives idn is a multidisciplinary field scholars and practitioners concerned with the topic originate from fields such as literary studies computer sciences games studies media studies fine art filmmaking consequently they not only bring a wealth of productive perspectives to the table but also differences in terminology this fact alone can be a cause for confusion yet it is further amplified by diverging meanings of the same term in different disciplinary contexts in the field there is a long standing issue we propose concrete steps towards the development of a shared vocabulary in the form of an online encyclopedia taking inspiration from the living handbook of narratology and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy this work is developed in the indcor eu cost action a network currently encompassing members from countries keywords interactive digital narrative interactive storytelling shared vocabulary multidisciplinarity online encyclopedia addressing the lack of a shared vocabulary for idn the lack of a shared vocabulary is a longstanding issue in the field of interactive digital narratives idn koenitz ferri and sezen koenitz et al koenitz koenitz thue and a longer version of this paper has been published as an indcor white paper on the pre print server arxiv https arxiv org abs carstensdottir the root of this problem is the fact that scholars and practitioners concerned with the topic of interactive narrative originate in a number of different fields including literature studies film studies computer sciences both from an artificial intelligence ai and human computer interaction hci perspective media studies creative practices and many more all of these fields have associated specific vocabulary the issue is further aggravated by the fact that many common terms used in interactive digital narrative research and practice such as narrative plot or story have both a common meaning in everyday conversation and also specific ones in scholarly and professional contexts the story of a journalist is not exactly the same as the story of a film director and what is exactly meant in each case is only fully accessible to practitioners in the respective fields in a recent article koenitz and eladhari compared this status to the biblical metaphor of the babylonian confusion in this paper we propose to address the issue through the creation of a living encyclopedia of idn vocabulary based on an overarching analytical framework spp model and associated taxonomy we detail the process for the creation and continued development of such a resource within indcor interactive narrative design for complexity representations eu cost network and also invite the community to participate in the development of this central aspect for the fledgling field of idn research and practice foundational considerations for a shared vocabulary in order to enable such a shared understanding an overarching analytical perspective is necessary this is an insight gained by our own experience in the indcor eu cost network the setup of workgroups was a bottom up approach developed by the expert community at the first meeting in brussels as work progressed a long list of terms to be defined in a shared vocabulary was quickly produced but subsequent discussions made clear that a consensus on how to connect different definitions was elusive consequently we identified the need of an overarching abstraction to guide our work on a shared vocabulary of idn without it there was a manifest risk that a shared vocabulary would replicate the existing babylonian confusion and thus miss its central aim in ongoing work and subsequent meetings in vienna and online the spp system process product model koenitz was the one singled out across workgroups that could function as a starting point for connecting the four pillars that are expressed as workgroups in indcor eu cost action indcor https indcor eu an overarching analytical perspective the spp model the spp model is a media specific perspective that identifies three broad categories for the analysis of idn artefacts reflecting its different stages system the digital artifact process the interactive experience of a system and product the result of the experience either in the form of a recording or as a retelling eladhari to others figure figure spp model koenitz the spp model takes the systemic dynamic character of idn works as its central characteristic building on a foundation laid by cybernetics wiener and cybernetic art theory ascott ascott as well as earlier perspectives on interactive forms of narration laurel jennings murray montfort murray in order to understand the specific aspects of idn and avoid limitations inherent in adapted perspectives the spp model does not rely on underlying models derived from the classical formal study of literature and the cinema in narratology instead it acknowledges the cognitive turn in narratology a perspective that understands narrative not as a property of certain types of artefacts but as a cognitive function a frame for constructing communicating and reconstructing mentally projected worlds herman this perspective opens up a space for novel kinds of narrative manifestations as in principle any artefact can be considered a narrative as long as it triggers the cognitive frame of narrative in other words an idn work does not need to be similar to the literary novel or the movie to be considered a narrative this view creates opportunities for both theoretical development and novel practices cf n katherine hayles call for a media specific analysis of digital forms of narration hayles and hausken s warning of media blindness on this basis the spp model is concerned with defining aspects of idn systems their processes and resulting products and organizes related concepts and design aspects accordingly for instance system contains the protostory the sum of all potential narratives that can be instantiated with a given artefact figure further aspects related to an idn work narrative design user interface assets environment definitions rule systems are subcategories of protostory this would mean for example that an ai engine is described as a rule system within the protostory and its particular implementation as a part of the narrative design conversely concepts practices and examples related to the manner in which an idn is presented to and experienced by an audience i e visual presentation interaction feedback would be represented within the category of process finally product describes the output of a process either as a recording objective product or as re telling eladhari subjective product figure protostory and its elements koenitz for the shared vocabulary project the spp model is used as a foundational analytical framework to connect central concepts of idn in terms of design and development theory building societal context and evaluation this choice is pragmatic based on several advantages spp emphasizes the specificity of this dynamic form thus providing a clear distinction from earlier fixed forms of narrative such as the printed novel or film and associated vocabulary and thus avoids the pitfalls of re defining existing terminology the spp model takes the systemic nature of idn artifacts as foundational building on a solid lineage of cybernetics cybernetic art and system theory the spp model continues efforts by scholars such as pamela jennings brenda laurel janet murray and nick montfort in understanding the specific aspects of interactive digital narratives the spp model features an inclusive view that acknowledges the wide variety of different forms of idn including hypertexts journalistic interactives narrative focused video games interactive documentaries installation pieces and ar vr work as well as emerging forms the spp model provides a high level model of idn works and their relationship with their audiences that is open both to extensions and further lower level specification and thus the spp model can serve as a central element in an idn taxonomy any choice of overarching analytical perspective is open to criticism and will be controversial to some researchers and or professionals yet there is the simple fact that a starting point must be chosen and given the above mentioned advantages the spp model provides a solid foundation a shared vocabulary does not mean that all differences in meaning or historical context would simply disappear or that scholarly dispute all of a sudden ends but that a coordinate system would be established against which extensions and alternative views can be discussed and understood conversely from this clear vantage point explicit connections can be drawn which will enable scholars to better understand each other and productively work together most importantly since we aim to make the concept of a shared vocabulary available for the whole community of researchers and designers it can serve as a hub for knowledge exchange and an important step in building a field accessible also to newcomers and related disciplines a taxonomy for idn extending the spp model the spp model is concerned with analyzing the idn artifact which means it does neither explicitly cover the conditions leading to a work ideation nor its creation process authoring conversely it also does not concern itself with societal effects of the work in question or on other works critical discourse as a broad framework it also does not provide the granularity necessary for an encyclopedia consequently the authors of this paper have developed a taxonomy for interactive digital narrative on the basis of the spp model with the top level categories of authoring artefact and critical discourse table the taxonomy relates authors contributions to an overall structure for example transformation is categorized as an aesthetic quality and thus an aim during the authoring process authoring ideation content aesthetic qualities transformation and an element of the experience of successful design artefact process experience aesthetic transformation we understand this taxonomy as a first effort version open to changes and amendments as the result of discussions and developments in indcor as well as in the research and practice communities at large the taxonomy itself represents the core of the shared vocabulary and as such provides a foundation which supports the community driven effort in developing a more extensive collection of terminology this explicitly means that further terms should be proposed and will be integrated to grow the vocabulary the focus here will be on concepts not already well defined in existing collections e g the living handbook of

idn with the foundational staxonomy in place the question is how to make the project accessible and enable community involvement and further development examples for accessible shared vocabularies exist in the form of online encyclopedias and this is the model we have decided to follow arguably the most successful example for general knowledge is wikipedia b the free online encyclopedia in the scholarly realm two particularly successful examples are the living handbook of narratology hühn and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy a both wikipedia and the scholarly resources are viable models we aim to follow the latter model for a variety of reasons and will be developing an online encyclopedia for idn research and practice an argument for creating an encyclopedia rather than a shared wikipedia is that based on the examples above these endeavors have proven more successful in terms of creating a complete and high quality curated result the reasons for this outcome are likely multifold but we speculate that an encyclopedia entry is more rewarding for authors to participate in since their efforts are clearly recognizable and properly credited as for its audience an encyclopedia appears to be more curated in both its individual content and as a whole since an encyclopedia by its nature promises to provide a more comprehensive view of a given topic rather than to rely on seemingly random selections and emphasis determined by wiki authors preferences this being said the two methods are not mutually exclusive a wikipedia site could likely serve well as a pre stage in the production of the encyclopedia of idn the way we envision it taking inspiration from the two examples of the living handbook of narratology hühn and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy a we see a strong editorial board as central to the success of this undertaking providing guidance and assuring academic excellence conversely we consider community engagement as crucial in making this undertaking a success editorial procedures which means to aim at a good balance of both aspects therefore the idn encyclopedia will be composed of articles written by authors from the community which have undergone a thorough peer review process articles will be published based on their academic rigor and the relevance of their contribution to the field the group of indcor chairs nine scholars originating in different disciplines and at different career stages will act as the initial editorial board and section editors soliciting authors from inside the project and the community at large for encyclopedia entries at the time of writing in may the indcor action consists of more than scholarly experts and professionals concerned with idn complexity representations indcor members would act as the initial group of reviewers but will be inviting additional experts from the field to assure a diversity of perspectives and a high level of quality content also for topics outside their core expertise the aim is to make the encyclopedia a high quality resource where each entry is recognized as a publication in its own right and thus writing for the encyclopedia is a rewarding undertaking for contributors conclusion and future work in this paper we have identified the lack of a shared vocabulary as a central issue for the field of interactive digital narrative in general we further identified the need for an overarching analytical perspective selected the spp model in this capacity and have proposed to address this issue through a communal expert authored and peer reviewed encyclopedia inspired by the successful examples of the living handbook of narratology and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy we propose a structure for such an effort and introduce a taxonomy as a starting point to gather definitions of concepts central to idn and useful across perspectives for scholars and practitioners in the field taking into account four lenses design and development conceptualization and theory evaluation and societal context we invite the research community to partake in the endeavor of creating a multifaceted living encyclopedia providing
