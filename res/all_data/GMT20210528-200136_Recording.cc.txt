when we start the recording now i think so so it s recording so welcome everybody hello everybody welcome okay we will start just now a i wanted to to welcome everybody and to say that the name of this panel is platform ization and the colonial elite is there any chance where we discuss the issue of platform ization and kind of culture from a latin american perspective and the colonial thinking usually the common trait of current platform culture is the maximization of profit by means of gathering data and attention in order to capture more attention and more that in this context is there any space for pursuing artistic digital activism and the colonial elliot okay the presentations will try to answer these questions even if in a provisional way people presenting here are learner so last i will send birthday and i read on myself the panel will be spanish english based in a sort of tentative of linguistic decolonization of our own it failed each one of us will have minutes for presenting and then we will open the discussion but feel free to make comments or post questionson the chat and we will try to go back to them after the presentations so leonardo you have the word

knownick what do you notice when we check it out is yes good ask you leo thank you very much now it s the turn off i will think we have you have set the theoretical framework for all of us so now i will think we ll continue with them so thank you leo for setting up yes the theoretical framework we had this plan to switch back and forth from spanish to english so i had the burden of speaking in english so i apologize in advance for that for my bit in english i have written short se which is available on the platform if anyone is interested my english is much better in writing and in speaking so digging on from from leo s abroad and losers idea i will present some intuitions that we ve been currently discussing between the four of us in several events and courses or scholarly and not so scholarly places we share it so it seems that thei just wanted to review the idea of let the phone yo which is a very common trope in latin american literature with regards to the platforms so i will just try to make a provocative an analogy of course is just sort of game in order to think the possibilities and try to think platforms as a form of land only so my intervention is called the country and the platform taking home from rain williams techcrunch in the city or the issue of nano phone via either no way this is not sharing the screen okay yes so some basic assumptions on what digital literacy digital culture is it before getting into elite first of all what there are some assumptions i would like to challenge first of all that this is a literal digital culture is not a process of de materialisation and we duty but rather process of miniaturization and acceleration with that miniaturization which takes place on servers and on networks makes way for large economies of scale which are based on data collection and data processing these data collection is allowed by this infrastructure that i mentioned before which operates according to standards standards are themselves a problem an epistemological problem worthy of attention i come basically from philosophy of technology and it is an important discussion going on on standards in philosophy and so digital reproducibility of cultural forms which operates in this form of standards of digital standards reduces cultural forms to unspecific forms of digital content i will not get too much into these because i discussed it elsewhere but i m just thinking critiquing here the idea of convergence culture by jenkins which is very popular so what has happened is that convergence content covered convergence culture has expanded the ideas of culture based on authorship and copyright presentation that depends on the corporate control of huge collections of digitized and digital content which create these lawyers economies of scale so i in my request a quote please natural history where he predicts the idea is one of the first and theoretical approaches to a critique of massive landowning or let the formula which has characterized the history of latin america until now it has been associated associated to extract the wisdom and so i think it s a resumes it summarizes many of the conflicts that underlie latin american literature and which are frequent when one studies latin american literature but such conflicts were also present in english literature as well as we bring on williams book the country the city which i quoted earlier suggests so my thesis is now that since the phone yet still exists of course but also now we are migrating to us a new landscape where there is an another form of london which is none of them so what are the roots of nano phone yeah i will i would characterize use nano phone to characterize major cultural platforms the roots of the phone there are the illusion of the materialisation which is actually as i said form of miniaturization the heads of democracies democratization and freedom of speech that end up in just being freedom of input as anyone who uses facebook may very well know the emergence of a new form of activism which is known as extremism they alleged universal accessibility ending up in a form of stratified accesses which scholarly journals exemplify very clearly but also all the forms of paywall and restricted surface access and the siren chance of optimization and rationalizationwhich started in the late s but with the neoliberal economy model oftaking over the the economical rationality in that in precarious labor or lean platforms specific characteristic them which are fueled by bike of lord and collaborator on cars as an uber or homes as in airbnb or other forms of surplus extraction so that is a i think a continuation of the concentration of land or property if your hands and that concentration is characterized by form of a meby the presence of the say fragile entities migrant entities either be them workers or a works in either form extra activism also operates in the real world and it has effects on the real world i heard some keynotes very especially the keynote on read books which took this impact into consideration and the the extension of digital technologies is also based on their orientation of the global south which in the end tense ends up being just google western colonialism in a new form so this modernization promises end up being just what we always knew now we will cooper want cope with it us elon musk s bluntly puts it so my question and i will be finishing with this is is there possible to develop a geopolitics of illiterate or taking on from jameson s idea of god and instead geopolitical aesthetics so my claim is that if there is to be a geopolitics of electronic literature the struggles will be about national and regional digital infrastructures and the local regulations over or trying to cope with the globalized attention economy the problem is about how much can we tolerate the expansion of cultural napoleon and i think it has a lot to say here because as neil put it it s the place where things go beyond what they are programmed to be or might be so with an iron brave who will follow after me withtry to identify the specifics ofthis kind of breaking the rules of the apparatus or opening the blood black box in the context of electronic literature and other forms of digital culture and we developed the concept the concept of an address which means making impossible the algorithmic appropriation of works or content or well they trying to prevent words from becoming near content so that this has been identified as a form of resistance but also a form of creativity i think and i will get a little bit deeper on that and to close my presentation i would say that my intuition is that a literature is a fertile ground to the for developing other forms of digital culture different sorry i wanted to avoid going over my time too much so i was saying my intuition is that a literature is a fertile ground for developing forms of digital culture other than platform capitalism towards a fair redistribution of digital space that is a politic and an aesthetic for the nano comments asto thank you very much so whoever has lived in latin america will recognize probably this album and i will leave you with an eye thank you i will have been other fellow umbra and i are you there you can start now yes okay and when a when a

several minutes to the open the discussion okay so my i will share my screen here so are you watching my screen but not insyria in korea yeah okay so i would focus okay thank you very much i will focus on latin america and elite that particularly engaging because drafting the linking and disruptively occupying contemporary platform culture this is a short presentation so i will not develop my theoretical framework i would have been working with the theoretical framework that is part of the colonial thinking in the way walter mineola elaborated or even the epistemologies of the south coined by the term was coined by voluntourism so santos these authors do not necessarily refer to the colonization regarding digital culture but they certainly give us a point of departure in terms of what the noise notion of the colonization means in order to not vandalize it or flatten i ve already written published an nsa er earlier this year and i will give you the link if you want to read it but shortly i will how okay here you have only a few quotes from them only from mineola and an evil econo who media manuals quoting also just in order to intro that this idea of the linking which is the main idea i will try to post now the idea that we need okay he begins with an eye on it but anyway they do that we need the need for politically under disturbing the linking comes here to the fore as do the colonizing knowledge and the colonial knowledge is as necessary steps to imagining and building democratic and non imperial colonial society doesn tknow they do that they did colonial the colonial shift is a project of the linking in spanish the linking in a way it is associate associated with this idea of econo they they spend their spirit of inclusiveness they ll atlassian allah masha allah allah colonial era in america armenian definitive icon total power capacity to either legacy to leave a sentence dividends but given that this panel is like a mix in english and spanish the stress i put here on mineola choice of this particular verb in english is not without implications to the link in english means to break the connection between something on something else but the noun and not to the delinquent also exist to refer to a person or maybe to qualify a behavior tending to commit crime particular myelogram in spanish the thing is different because spanish speaking people thought kind of had to associate this english word to it s a disruption like something that is out of law meaning since belling gil in spanish only and only means to break the law so it s like we can we hear that word in english but we did codify this word in spanish changing the meaning then the main meaning the word has and as you may know what the mineola is an argentinian who has been teaching in the united states sincethe s so i think this panel i think he s also very aware of these nuances of the of the world okay as you see my approach today is kind of a cultural and linguistic one according to the title of my my presentation that suggests that besides the linking we can also bond the colonial thinking to a more activist way of conceiving that the colonial sheets in terms of occupying colonial spaces the idea of occupy the streets of course is behind this however the similarities between occupying the streets and occupying digital platforms have its limit there s several similarities but there are differences i cannot go farther but the potential empowerment of the people and emancipator is social transformations that in certain circumstances mike derived from occupying streets are usually more tangible that the mc but the potentials that might derive from just occupying digital platforms and i wanted to stress just occupy and i have a chilean example but i don t have time to everything chilean it s something about this but i don t have time to developit anyway my main argument build but that would not mean death to occupy the platforms as they are occupied the platforms means to be there i know but also to the link to deviate and to open up ways of seeing and deal with what digital platforms culture means while we are there and ultimately it means to invent new platforms and they structural base as well so in regards to latin american league i think we can enumerate listed some but also different differentiate some possible paths one of them would be a complete change regarding means of production but is there any chance for live to do something else in the meantime before if ever that change occur occurs the other way would be to explore experimental political digital literature the keep the language is activism and sort of interventions of the on the digital machine as a whole or in part third level could be exploring the colonial discernment involved in experimental isn t and even interventions in mainstream platform culture related to contemporary social media and the fourth level could be digital activism in indigenous indigenous languages i will only refer to the second and the third level of efficacy of these roads i m thinking of levels because maybe the extreme efficacy would come if we if we could change infrastructures as i was didn t told us but in the meantime i will refer for example to this second level of frequency which is close to the first one andi think we can find many many examples in a latin american elite of experimental political digital literature some digital languages activism programming languages activism included and the elite that intervenes the digital machine as a whole or inpart i m thinking here in elite works that not only the familiarize digital environments and they are for dances but the based on digital languages themselves and even interrupt the digital apparatus as a whole in kenya disraeli s well now works under the tag of algorithm politics such as that are the seven or email body naturally brasileira america naughty or amazon or perhaps the more vivid examples but also other words by the family which clear intervenein the realm of the means of production for into instance certain autonomous digital infrastructures like aka was he defines aka boss as an open source mobile web platform for the collaborative creation of maps and community memories the same for environments with low or no connectivity here you have an image of amazon i think this work can give us some hints for these options within the second level of disruptive efficacy again we have here at it with many nuances amazon for the amazon rainforest in brazil which is being clear cut at the rate of three footballfields per minute but also for one of the most symbolic global corporations of these st century which literally honoring its name began as a company devoted to the global online selling of printed books using paper of course except product ofthe same deforestation a corporation that has diversified nowadays in huge proposed proportions into a universal production of digital audio visual content every day i go live and flow in other words in other words to make visible the linking between all the components of the work called as a vector i m quoting a vector that transforms your desires into that third capital son and even fastest were men machines amazon the defaultwork work makes the city the code leading us to do something else that clicking to execute it be just a small step in between the formula is station steps and to their progress a kinetic visual poetry in a time that visual poetry passion the words concept that links numbers algorithms capitalism and the tragedy of burning forest ultimately the destroying of life itself okay you can of course explore the world and not wanting to extend on that i think it would be worth it to pay attention not now because i will run out of time but to pay attention to the hyperlink in the text in the work that leads to an estatethat statement by this early on code on coding a he says that the code of amazon ht ml is i m quoting now is written in a compressed format often called mini mini mini five which makes it very difficult to read to convey the idea that the code of this piece was something condensed and obscure a okay we could we can discuss if you want this work later a third level the colonial that tournaments involved in experimental ism but also interventions in mainstream platform culture related to contemporary social medialead us to this example which is broken english an online initiative identified itself as a free access digital publisher they were founded in in in mexico by david martinez and canada and i only told also bit festive resounds all along the side we can see these for instance in the motto of broken english loudspeaker editorial punto lol the one and only publishing house that ll we can easily associate the name of the name broken english with a d colonial jester regarding regarding politics of languages because it s an online publishing publishing initiative in spanish that chooses to name itself not in proper english but in broken english this kind of kind of self reflection and estrangement from mason digital culture also includes the addition ofa series of poetry books and the remediation in the homepage of the latin american inverted map taken from net dot our latino database a well known pioneer net our piece by brian mccann in which there you are your net artist remediated the previouslywell known growing american better theater showing the mark of the map of south america upside down down by the painter hopingthat we can easily relate to the notion of a piece of technology of the sounds but all these is interwoven in broken english with the purest language and raw material that shape nowadays digital culture since means and bots have have a truly mainrole in broken english if we pay attention to the website visual interface we get the same impression of fusion between experimentalism amazing digital culture a fusionthat perhaps enables broken english to be something more than a reproductive commodity while nevertheless participating off a new generation of sensibility their website homes their website homepage chosen sort of th interface black screen white korea new front but the hint that that s not all is shown both in the brilliant green twinkling letters with which serve as hyperlinks and in the disruptive green reflection that regularly process the screen when clicking in many of these links and explosion of colors fonts comic like high stakes and call it and colleges interface i do not have time another very interesting example in broken english is a digital piece called a pompous barona political moment notes towards in mean means poetic by chilean poet jonathan oh paso which is also behind kuma tron and experimental butwe refrigerator that releases a unit book of poetry in pdf even with a unique design cover each time someone that says the site ok i will not refer develop this thing about this intermediate eastside but i think it s a very interesting so you can read about these in the article i published i referred before finally in my fourth level of secrecy draft i will say that fourth level which i do not have time here to develop to literally digital activism in indigenous languages sometimes this activism only occupies the platforms using indigenous languages but not the linking from mason digital epistemologies i do not know in latin america any project equivalent for instance to john corbett s languages cree and ancestral code which were referredin another panel yesterday or i don t know remember when but for sure they activate my land was in deaconess network has been growing during the last decade so i okay that many things we could think about the level of decolonization implicating in activation in indigenous languages and the level of not decolonization also implicated there but i think i will not have time for that finally my conclusion provisionally is that one of these cases are strictly experimental elite based on the difficult this alien doris or a sense of their colonial mixtures between experimentalism and third generation platform elite or digital activismin indigenous indigenous languages there is an opening for discussing how it might temporarily occupy contemporary platforms without being completely absorbed by the agenda so i will stop share now and that s all of my presentation today but we can open the discussion i think that theoretically my co presenters have really a post very interesting questions and okay some are there any thoughts in the chat maybe lil lil flores wants to eat okay let s see i m trying to read the room let s do it in english since i know there that not everyone speaks spanish i want to congratulate late you all for for a great great talk a great set of talks i wanted to begin just by just i mean i thought no matter the layer my talk i made a really great theoretical framing of everything and i think one of the questions i have is and i can ask it in spanish as well is and i think gloria begins to give the answer so this is a question that may go across several of you where do you see the space for agency right because i think we use platforms but we also have bro board right and we also want to transcend them so where i mean i think one of the dangers is is is to presume that platforms capture and have this power over and they do they re designed to do that but where are the limits of that and where s their space for agency necessity prophetic a travel calibre will cover it they lose where you re being so k no software can offer mama akiko graca dortmunder can offer mama libra a program income we re not casa de de la lasat movement for no a pair or attack a punto but i don t is a career but i think that layer so last also post that yeah yeah so i mean rich both of you yeah but just elaborate right okay leo so last um yeah well it s very high the no depression about agency i will take it from the point of subjective experience i think we have all lived this experience that we are scrolling through the endless stream of some social network and we are we feel that we are capture we feel that our attention is captured we feel that we have spent too much time already looking at stuff that is not actually relevant for us or is repetitive but somehow we are deprived of our willpower we have been our willpower has been replaced by an agency of the system so at that moment we are clearly optimized we can we can find it as a feeling i think we all know and we also get bored at some point maybe too late we can extricate ourselves from that experience and look at from a different point of view and say well that was too much i spent too much time on twitter or facebook and at that point solution set us free for what for what for something else go cooking go for a run read a book whatever which doesn t happen on the platform happens on the on the rest of the world now us what to do was when when when we get rid of the ultimate ization of the system while my proposal is expressed on the on those three forms of freedom is that well we can still have a relationship with the ultimate icing system from a differentpoint of view which is a critical point of view which is a point of view that is meta is in another level we are not inside the system where we are kind of looking at it from a bow trying to understand this logic and the act of understanding is logicenables a series of new possibilities is a different game we are not playing the game of the system anymore we are playing our own game about the system because we can comment on it we can make a network about it we can try to hack it or whatever which is not part of the original plan of the of the signers of the system so that that is engaging with the system still but in a very different way with a very different attitude so that will be my take on this difficult problem i can add another thing which i think it s more explicit on latin american elite though its present in the other forms of elite come around i m not an as an expert as many people here i just i was sort of a tourist on elite and and i and i ended up inin philosophy of technology but he he low minutes some of the more relevant issues for fighters with technology and philosophy of digital but i think that the the political dimension is more explicit on latin american elite because of their material limitations constraints and needs of innovation or debate or questioning it s on the very nature of the latin american elite i know so yes that thank you for the lucky phone connection yeah but i think that i want to i found it very interesting when nick s lasik post the thesis that the platform economy is just another step of copy that is mode of production so you have for this and then you have autism and now you have platform capitalism and there is a continuing at and there is the the old good old struggle over surplus and the extraction surplus and the problem that he could pose the question of labor so it makes it possible to rethink us previous latin american literature made it possible to think it previous latin american literature focused on the let the phone do and the agrarian reform and the primary session of economies you know it s it sa common trait in in all the legendary conditions right now so from the bottom up to a random set of areas to any all the colombian literature or no audience yeah and so on you can trace this problem of land ownership and concentration so i would think that this the platform economy is another place that the illustrator may enable thinking alternative road so that the idea of the slave that we try to develop with an eye and it s still an ongoing project aims at this agency the agency is in the moment of of escapingthe call but at the same time that also station is tactical in the sense that it prevents the extraction of surplus or the identification of people or the policing or whatever platform a decision making automated decision making is running there but at thesame time it s a space for creativity for new forms ofreal or for new ways of relationship on different modes less extra activist less the violent modes of production but it s just an intuition and of the answers the question though i think that a this notion of an address by addressing this reference yeah really fast young and the idea of the linking and reinventing a from the from a basis of the linkingour products are productive i have ways of trying to i don t know i was trying to think possibilities for a lead and i i agree with justin that in latin american elite there is strongerbias towards politics asian a in a geo political i know not so not only the geographical sense but for example i ve been working a lot of time during a lot of time on a language geopolitics in latin american elite i think this thing is something that we should explore evenmore and not only from the perspective of languages as spanish get to our support echo whatever portuguese but programming languages as well that s why i refer to that idea i m not sure if there are any programming languages developed in latin american which engage with indigenous indigenous languages for example i don t know i really don t know but this is something that we should think not only in the relation betweenthe global not on the global south but within the global sound because spanish and portuguese are hegemonic languages in the region so we have also the or something would have said say i think is something that many elite that is everywhere but in latin american in latin america it shows a bias on geopolitical questions and phone maybe this is the way i don t know i tried to open possibilities always knowing that within this possibilities there are also the possibilities of being called i don t know if we knew english they work since the same called battle i think that we should be always aware that this possibility is always there because of that usually experimental artists are always changing places going farther moving around you know because they experiment and political procedures many times are co opted by the the machine itself the system itself as layout so last post the if you like i have a small case of what leo was wondering the within the platforms regarding taste i remember a poem by another tara tara never know how to pronounce his name who support from from argentina that there was an illegal play police repression in the south overland ownership know the communities were demanding world you re buying a land from a wealthy landowner and theywere being i know this the verb in english that kicked out of the land so in this context of violence a young man white european descent young man activists that was there went missing he he was found drowned in the river two months later so there was a it was a motorist first disability seal you know i said what the impact is so warm person in argentina which was some del mondo now and he posted there was a lot of questions to bring the government employee involved the government in providing answers as to where was this young man and he s born was the broken image in facebook you know the the icon where where the victor is missing the text the caption of the picture would say in this place there should be the picture of a young man and he described the very popular the the image that had been popularized by the family and the people that were requesting the orient to look forhim and he described very politically his face which was not there as it wasn t on as he was missing in other time so that was in facebook so he was so subverting the facebook main hit what made facebook famous for that was showing pictures you know he was showing the non picture of this person that was missing and that was just a very witty example of subversion within the platforms making these that didn t work but when you useslide the mouse or the pointer over the the image the porn came out so that s just a little example of these disputes and small agencies within the platform that are not about changing the taste but rather of incriminating it i would say hey i know north sea turtles work is in the antelope valley philip pullman owner and the the image of santo maldonado is part of one of his poems which we included in the envelope here it s not the same because it s not facebook but he remediated i think this same poem or at least part of it in another one or maybe it s the same one i m not sure so you can you can check this work in envelope here the lead volume no no so is there any question in the chat possible yes poems in facebook three the poems in facebook okay so i m not sure chat so yeah we ll see ya know smart things when they re so there okay so i will have to read the chat now but anyway so if there any more questions i will like to thank you all very much because this is just one of the last panel yellow conference and they okay i think we see you around somewhere i know these and difficult in this car yes but the thing is passes away the car yes yes or you can finish by noon in cages tobacco tobacco fit into usable by surprise say they ll probably my my bodies are practical and they asked at a casino allah don t drink process a ebola down to tampa discord in florida that amino acid in
