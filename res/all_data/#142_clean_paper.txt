elo conference and festival platform post pandemic co chairs søren pold university of aarhus and scott rettberg university of bergen may th an institutional approach to building a platform of digital literary works the case s of dutch and flemish digital literature siebe bluijs tilburg university the netherlands please allow me to start this paper by making my intentions clear right away my goal is to present our research project on electronic literature to explain our theoretical approach and most important of all to learn from researchers who have tackled similar issues and questions therefore it is a great privilege to be able to present the project for you today at this conference and i look forward to your comments and questions introducing the project the recently formed dutch digital literature consortium a partnership of researchers from dutch universities the royal library of the netherlands and local libraries aims to develop and launch an online catalogue of digital literature created in the netherlands and flanders between and and turn this collection into a publicly accessible digital database the project draws inspiration from comparable databases such as the electronic literature collection nt hermaneia and literatura electrónica hispánica cf pablo goicoechea whereas these databases bring together digital literary projects from a variety of traditions the project at hand focuses exclusively on works from a specific linguistic area the catalogue s target audience can be divided into three domains academic research education in particular secondary education and public libraries the consortium s aim is to launch the online catalogue by the end of it will be hosted by clariah common lab research infrastructure for the arts and humanities a distributed research infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences funded by the dutch government in preparation for the catalogue the consortium gratefully makes use of the elmcip infrastructure in compiling a provisional list of electronic literature from the netherlands and flanders the list can be found here https elmcip net research collection digital literary works flanders and netherlands such a development of a database of electronic literature gives rise to several theoretical and methodological questions the first category of questions concerns the problem of documentation which works and genres are eligible to be included in the database and on what grounds can we make this selection how are we to find metadate and categorize all available expressions of digital literature created in the netherlands and flanders as a postdoctoral researcher it is my role to formulate answers to these questions and as such lay a theoretical foundation for the database the second category of questions concerns the issue of implementation we wish to turn the collection into a digital catalogue that meets the fair findable accessible interoperable and reusable principles wilkinson et al a second postdoc who will start in october will be responsible for this second phase at the moment we are still in the documentation stage of the project in the remainder of this paper i will focus on our approach and present some preliminary results finally i would very much appreciate any feedback or comments on this plan an institutional approach the questions of documentation critically hinge on the fundamental question what electronic literature is given the changing nature of electronic literature it is not very productive to try to pin down the phenomenon based on a limited number of fixed characteristics cf tabbi nevertheless we need a starting point on which to base the selection criteria of the database as a first step to the theoretical foundation of our database we take on an institutional approach to electronic literature the question what belongs to the domain of electronic literature has been answered explicitly and implicitly by different actors and institutions involved with electronic literature such as funding institutions libraries academic scholars and other gatekeepers if as florian cramer claims electronic literature ha s established itself as a field in pierre bourdieu s sense i e as an area of production and discourse with intrinsic distinctions and authorities cramer then we need to consider how such authorities push electronic literature in specific directions electronic literature is institutionally framed in various ways by initiating and financing projects institutions unmistakably leave a mark on the material production of electronic literature van dijk they also play an important role in the symbolic production of the art form this term refers to the question of whether a particular work belongs to the domain of electronic literature but also applies in a more general sense to the question of whether electronic literature should be regarded as a separate literary genre lastly institutions often play an important role in the distribution of electronic literature research centers and governmental organizations display electronic literature through online channels and in non pandemic times on festivals and other events our institutional approach consists of an analysis of the discourse surrounding electronic literature in the netherlands and flanders first we examine which digital genres and individual works are considered literary by the institutions next we examine what is considered digital within specific contexts lastly we consider how the qualifications of the literary and the digital interact in the discourse of these institutions the next step is to bring this discourse in relation to current debates within the international field of electronic literature the benefits of an institutional approach in our view an institutional analysis is productive for a number of reasons first an institutional analysis is valuable because it provides insight into processes of inclusion and exclusion which works and forms are institutionally regarded as electronic literature and on what grounds which forms have been overlooked are there works that no longer fit within the contemporary framework of electronic literature in addition to this we believe an institutional approach can acommodate the fact that our own database is caught up in institutional dynamics as well in other words it provides a comparative starting point for our own selection criteria second an institutional approach does justice to the fluid nature of electronic literature in our view an institutional analysis is contingent on a media and literary historical analysis it allows us to consider transformations in both the media landscape and the literary landscape after all what is considered digital and what is considered literary changes over time lastly attention to the institutional frameworks provides insight into the unique aspects of electronic literature in the low countries of course we are aware that electronic literature is also a transnational phenomenon however we believe that electronic literature always takes shape within a specific techno cultural context as well by paying attention to the various ways in which institutional frameworks shape and determine electronic literature we can bring the specificities of the dutch and flemish electronic literature traditions into focus our approach is thus a plea to consider the art form in relation to specific contexts preliminary results the preliminary results of our research into the institutional framework surrounding electronic literature in the low countries illustrate this final point in flanders and the netherlands the institutional framework of digital literature is largely reliant on governmental subsidy providers considering the traditional literary institutions the letterenfonds the dutch fund for literature is arguably the most important institution to support this art form as became clear at an expert meeting on electronic literature organized by the dutch reading foundation stichting lezen in this fact points to an important difference with other language areas in the united states for instance electronic literature has traditionally found a home at universities it is taught at creative writing courses and many electronic literature pioneers have been employed at universities in the words of florian cramer e lectronic literature was and continues to be as closely tied to literature departments as composed computer music is to research lab style university studios at least in northern america on top of that the critics were often the same people as the artists in those two academic communities cramer in flanders and the netherlands such an institutional embedding is absent literature departments do play an important role however in the symbolic production of electronic literature in fact scholarship has been the most important form of reception as yra van dijk explains due to the absence of traditional gate watchers like publishers and newspaper critics the function of selection distribution and reception of this work has been taken over partly by anthologies reviews and criticism that are produced in an academic climate van dijk thus far publishers have largely ignored electronic literature cf stiller literary magazines have occasionally paid attention to the phenomenon baetens vos van adrichem the institutional framework unmistakably leaves its mark on the productions all projects funded by the letterenfonds for instance involve authors who can be institutionally classified as literary authors on the one hand this qualification points petitio principii to their role in the literary domain their works have been published by literary publishers and they have often won literary the notable exception is victor gijsbers who is a professor of philosophy at leiden university and a renowned author of interactive fiction awards on the other hand the term literary also concerns a judgement of value a publication by the letterenfonds and branch organization kvb boekwerk mentions the unmistakable literary qualities of the electronic literature productions they have highlighted the authors specify these qualities as nuance complexity empathy and defamiliarization dresscher e a overseeing the productions of electronic literature created with financial help of the letterenfonds a clear division of roles stands out as well the literary authors provided the text while a team of creator s was responsible for the technical realization the institutional framework thus partly determines the shared authorship of digital literature as is shown by yra van dijk in her analysis of works financed by the letterenfonds van dijk cf hayles arnoud van adrichem and jan baetens interpret the institutional embeddedness of electronic literature as an attempt to encapsulate a phenomenon that threatens to undermine traditional actors of the literary field they claim that literary institutions have shielded electronic literature as an experimental form with a highbrow image the scholarship on electronic literature in flanders and the netherlands has focused on works that meet this description as well almost all academic studies on electronic literature from flanders and the netherlands date from the first decade of the millennium see for example van looy van adrichem van adrichem baetens van dijk these studies mainly focus on animated poetry and works that make use of the affordances of the internet in other words scholarship has been limited to works of the second generation to refer to n katherine hayles s famous distinction hayles this is no surprise considering that as phillipe bootz has pointed out in a european context hypertext has not been the dominant mode but rather textual generators and animated works hayles cf bootz alternative approaches generally electronic literature from flanders and the netherlands is institutionally understood as a form of experimental literature that was at its peak in the first decade of the millennium the question arises to what extent this conception of electronic literature eclipses alternative conceptions in a article florian cramer argued that the notion of electronic literature as intrinsically experimental fails to reflect the way in which literary forms are disseminated and consumed in our current digital age the nature of digital media and their impact on society and their place in people s lives have changed dramatically over the past two decades a renewed look at electronic literature can shed light on both the present and the past of this art form recent international scholarship on electronic literature offers starting points for such an approach approaches of the first and second generation explicitly considered electronic literature in relation to the concept of new media these approaches have run along two tracks on the one hand there is an emphasis on the continuity with older artistic traditions on the other hand electronic literature breaks with these traditions which has mainly to do with the affordances that digital media bring cf rettberg maria engberg jay david bolter for instance consider brian kim stefans s the dream life of letters stefans as a continuation of avant garde poetry which stefans s flash poem seems to complete engberg bolter this approach has been fruitful understanding the affordances that the computer has provided for literature as an art form however while computers are still relatively young in comparison to the technology of the book we can ask ourselves to what extent the notion of digital media as new still holds up today as the nature and function of digital media in society has shifted scholars have argued for new approaches to electronic literature one of these scholars is spencer jordan who states running alongside the tradition of the avant garde and the experimental electronic literature is a more recent condition which rather than responding to digital technology s novelty and originality is instead a recognition of its overwhelming presence in everyday life jordan he adds in a world where computerisation is fundamentally normalised any understanding of the digital as subversive and radical becomes redundant jordan in this light it is necessary to go beyond the paradigm of literary experimentation this opens the door to forms that do not align themselves with the literary tradition formed by the print world as the second generation did flores leonardo flores has proposed the label of rd generation e literature for works that instead can be identified with electronic and digital media in terms of its formats and publication models flores one of the most popular forms in this category is instagram poetry in recent years dutch and flemish poets who publish their work exclusively on instagram and twitter have gained popularity dera van der starre in the low countries their work is hardly ever considered as a form electronic literature however since this label is reserved for the more experimental works of earlier years the question of whether instagram poetry should be classified as electronic literature is still under debate in the community of electronic literature scholars cf berens the case of instagram poetry does show that an institutional approach that only considers the traditional gatekeepers i e academia publishers funding institutions has its limitations if we want to understand electronic literature we also need to take its users into consideration as flores suggests when he writes that third generation digital literature coexists with the previous one and accounts for a massive scale of born digital work produced by and for contemporary audiences for whom digital media has become naturalized x cf gitelman when we leave behind the strict focus on literary experimentation an alternative story about electronic literature in the low countries opens up recently there has been institutional appreciation for early hypertext stories albeit not from an academic or a literary perspective the hypertext works nijmeegs avontuur wim couwenberg and hollanditis john vanderaart were included in the videogames canon which was initiated by the netherlands institute for sound and image these works are part of the history of video games from the low countries but they belong to the history of electronic literature as well especially because of their reliance on text a history of dutch and flemish hypertext fiction remains to be written cf van looy equally little is known about forms of prehistoric electronic literature to use christoper funkhouser s apt label for forms of electronic literature that predate the hypertext works from the s and s articles on gerrit krol and greta monach point to the fact that dutch authors experimented with the possibilities of the computer as early as the s mourits martin additional research into both literary and non literary forms of early computer experimentation is needed concluding remarks considering that the first volume of the electronic literature collection dates from one could say our database of electronic literature from flanders and the netherlands arrives somewhat late to the party this late arrival however gives us the opportunity to draw on the extensive international scholarship on electronic literature and to place different emphases the preliminary results of our institutional approach show that the traditional gatekeepers of electronic literature in the low countries have framed the genre as a form of highbrow experimental literature that was at its peak in the first decade of the millennium while literary experimentation is without a doubt an important aspect of the form s history and genealogy there are other possible conceptions and forms of electronic literature that can and should have a place in its historiography as well we can consider for instance how electronic literature relates to the history of digital media in a larger sense in such an approach the history of video games overlaps with that of electronic literature additionally we should recognize that the users of digital media have institutional agency as well in this regard the popularity of forms like instagram poetry for instance challenges traditional conceptions of electronic literature bibliography van adrichem a van adrichem ed
