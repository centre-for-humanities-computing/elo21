 recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for the exploration of creative interactive works based around generative text this paper compares two such works ai dungeon walton and project december rohrer both of which are built on the same artificial intelligence ai platform openai s gpt and gpt in ai dungeon the player can choose from several predetermined worlds each of which provide a starting point for the story generation however while interacting with the system within this world the player can stop edit modify and retry each utterance allowing the player to sculpt the ai s responses and choose what goes into the ai s memory helping to shape the overall direction of the story at a broader level the player can edit world descriptions insert scripts between the ai and the player themselves or others and share these worlds scenarios with other players similarly in project december the player interacts with several ai matrices either directly through conversations or more indirectly by creating new matrices by defining a starting paragraph and sample responses which can then be spun up tested and tweaked much like the worlds in ai dungeon these matrices can also be shared with other players when interacting with both works there is a need for the player to repeatedly engage with the work to learn how to entice a satisfying experience from the system mitchell however the key difference is the framing of the experience in ai dungeon the person experiencing the work is either taking on the role of the player entering text and seeing how the ai responds or that of an author or perhaps a co author tweaking the input to the ai or its responses or adjusting the underlying scenario to get a desired response in contrast project december is presented as part of a fictional website for a elo project december run by rhinehold data systems promising the opportunity to talk to the world s most super computer upon accessing the customer terminal which looks and feels like an old dialup terminal the player takes on the loosely defined role of professor pedersen whose plan file dated november contains several tasks related to the various matrices suggesting a mystery to be solved and a larger narrative to be explored i will argue that whereas ai dungeon attempts to provide players with access to and an uncritical understanding of how the underlying ai system works project december s narrative framing instead defamiliarizes the play experience mitchell et al potentially creating a more emotional connection between the player and the matrices and thereby encouraging the player to critically reflect on the implications of the underlying technological platform
