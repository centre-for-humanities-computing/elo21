i don t think we have the live transcripts just yet we have the button just over everyone can choose individually to see it yeah you can see in this easy perfect so if you need it great so welcome everyone to today s panel will continue with the recording if that s okay i for those of you who haven t met me before my name is susie cronan and the content of our panel today the title is game storytelling and methodology will followthe order of the program so first off we have hannah documents and hannah s presentation is entitled follow the pathfinders a case study approach to production use and readership on the scalar so we re looking forward to hearing from you hannah thank you very much put the link right now and i should start by apologizing you will get like fancy powerpoints and presentations and videos later but i have to run the last two days so i prioritize that so i will just be talking to you instead that s minutes so affect as scholars and artists and electronic literature we have a soft spot for media specific analysis but term going by and catrin hills for interrogating the math reality of literary hypertext are no longer just a research subject they re also our means of communication and publication there have been various born digital channels and platforms that encouraged scholars to use multimodal means with academic publication each with their ownmedia specificity specificity so i ve done a deep dive into that by now canonical book pathfinders documenting the experience of early digital literature in pathfinders stewart multiple and danny greer document for classic works electronic device that you re using aof films books bruce by authors and readers known as reversals along with films interviews and carefully described and photographed physical materials as such pathfinders is positioned as a dh practice to rescue early works of electronic literature both from technological obsolescence end of life again so what i wanted to know is how the platform performances influence the production and circulation of the book and the best way to research that s fine there as well so of course by hosting some rehearsals with my own on zoom i interviewed dinnick regard about the process of creating pathfinders and i have three readers with various degrees of experience withelectronic literature read this book for the first time now i couldn t possibly go through all of my results in these few minutes but what i found was that the media specificity was deeply tied to production and use of the platform the institutional embedding the technological ecology and the promotion ofresearch values so rather than an isolation of the media text itself my contextual approach allows me to reflect on the media specificity as implemented within the medial and academic network that s fine there s uses the platform scalar which is very as important sis to accommodate multimedia and multi linear research specifically built for humanities publications although there is a learning curve to scalar and my readers were confused when they first started looking at that finders the wider use of it allows for both authors and readers to familiarize themselves with a common structure of research and publication at the same time the users can choose which elements to adopt an appropriate to serve to suit their needs and ideas dini explain for example that was important that pathfinders would look scholarly and bookish so the institution on bedding influences how authors choose and approached our media content as well as how to book is circulated and read readers consider academic validity through a combination of their evaluation of the content and there are other experiences with born digital publication with born digital publication one of my readers for example has a background in film studies and she compared it to a video essay in her fields and she also said that she was reminded of the streaming platform twitch so what follows is the technological influence of the combination of platforms which extends the book beyond the self contained text different platforms such as vimeo and soundcloud are embedded and readers can cross through relevant external websitesusing the hyperlinks or they can encounter parts of the work through other channels before even entering the book so this inevitably leads to differences and interpretation by different breeders and the explicit role of the different platforms highlights this practice the center of focus on situation on network documentation for grants the value of documentation and presentation as officer sorry the value of documentation and presentation of sources as research the spontaneity and interpretation are integral partof what is presented as the documentation of the networks themselves to conclude for media specific analysis has become commonplace in various studies of creative digital effects analysis was born digital academic publications could enhance the understandingof these particular text as well as contribute to a more intricate application of media specificity to include context academia in particular has explicit and implicit customs of creating cultural capital in producing and circulating knowledge as publicationis a primary in principle mode for which scholars get to know each other s works scrutiny of their among scrutiny of their media mode is necessary to understand the fields so i will leave it at this for now and i look forward to discussing it with you further great thank you so much that was really rich and interesting a lot packed in there to a short short time and we ll go for questions at the end so we ll run straight into our next presentation if that s ok with everyone so next up is bronwyn patrick sin welcome runway with accuracy in title or do we call this so we know a little bit about your about your presentation from the video we saw so looking forward to hearing more about that no thank you susie and i was really interested in your paper hannah too because i do also talk about the impact of technology on the genre in my paper but i ve actually dropped a lot of that discussion in this to try and keep it to five minutes yeah interesting field and game genres are different as well to literary genre so there s that interesting crossover but i m sorry during and i was lucky enough to work on a wallace and gromit theme digital storytelling project self described as a documented story wallace and gromit being fixed up is a really interesting hybrid project involving transmedia and mobile and minted reality play as well as a single strand story and it raised it for your wishes that i want to talkabout in this talk partly about the hybridity of genres these days but also about the aesthetics of a single strand story of just to say for this project i was working with the university of south wales as part of the collaboration with a consortiumof creative commercial practitioners dub fiction is in a uk funded audience of the future just demonstrate a project i ll start by playing you an excerpt from there behind the scenes video so they can get an idea of the app some really helps to havea look at it it s very exciting a great pitch it s a brand new wallace and gromit story video gameplay comic strips hold held together by an app that people will download an app on their smartphone audiences will interact with wallace and gromit calls tax and even when you can savea rocket appears in your backyard it s just a fundamental reshaping of what stories so this is a quote from edward russell who s one of the producers of the project who featured in the video and i m going to let that video continuous talk it s got the rest of this behind the scenes video as well as some etc let s play and other relevant productions to talk about he goes on to say i m learning to say it s an interactive immersive storytelling experience realized through augmented reality on your phone that s the fastest way of saying it but even that doesn t sort of bring in the transmedia and everything so this was a challenge and it was partly about the use of emerging technologies that people were as much familiar with like ar as well as a mix of story and gameplay within wallace and gromit before except app which had implications particularly in terms of the expectationthat audiences brought to it in hybrid fields of possibilities double barreled way market terms like interactive narrative as opposed to term narratives game for example a very helpful as they signal the relative weight of any particular genre mix and they can also indicate related audience cultures but they can also be misleading at times potentially emphasizing the politics of the referral media over the emerging products of the new media mix so to turn to that now turn to the app in more detail it s delivered via a central enhanced mobile application the application presents a predetermined story delivered by rich tapestry of serialized short multi platform media elements unlike traditional transmedia where network media might be distributed across a number of platforms the entire multimedia story is presented by the central mobile application so this offers a rich and variable experience but also highlights the classic occasion challenges that genre defying emerging technologies compose the participatory capacity or agency to make meaningful choices in an unfolding experiences traditionallyregarded as one of the great pleasures of digital storytelling in big fix up the newsfeed progression is made more dynamic because of the variety of media presents as well as the story progression that enables over time the lure of emerging technologyengagements linked to that position also help to make that process more intriguing together the serialized transmedia storytelling strategies for mobile phone delivery offered away for fiction is to exploit alternative x alternatives to branching narrative structures and this is an example it s gone on a bit i ll just pause this for sick so this is a great example for you to see now part of the motivation for this approach animation takes a long time to me and they there s a risk of course if you get into this branch into narratives that we ve got competent tutorial explosion there are established workarounds but they were really keen to look at this single story strand and link it to the choice to choose which bits you you engage with and then also link to gameplay and these are also referring different pledges and agency there so there are different pleasures as this one maybe a few of you are familiar with even cowgirls bleed these about the ascetic pleasures of an experience and this is you know the rhythmic and the sound of the of the gunplay and the signal to move you know you re moving your holster from side to side and then the visual humor of the page itself becoming bloodied so each clip reveals a bit more of the unfolding story enhanced by the surprise such a novel and interns perfect and this approach supports and engaging participatory experience even despite the lack of meaningful agency and other examples of digitally reference kinesthetic pleasures or rewards as they might be referred to and gave me discourse you might rememberthe intermediate audio fx and feed update animations like in allen bigelow s mobile search style narrative how to rob a bank now in following projects fiction is are exploring ways that multi perspective narratives told through the overlapping and potentially contradictory iterations of multiple characters can also complement the news feed plot progression this approach prompts and other alternative to the pleasure of agency which is the pleasure of evaluation in some games genres the pleasures of evaluation forms strategy choices strategy choices sorry and they also and we ve moved on to another project now but i want to show you this is part fishing this is an interactive documentary and they can involveethical dilemmas to prompt deep reflection this scrolling documentary indicates yes another way to introduce evaluative interaction into a single scrolling story participants are cast as training investigators who can help the pirate fishing investigation team by evaluating and classifying media elements according to the type of information provided with it s evidence notes or background information i ll justhave to move this because i realize you can t see that so they re actually moving that around and they re all sorts of ways you can see that something like that developing so as these numerous examples indicate there are captivating alternatives and adjustments to branching tree plot structures many of which involve genre hybridity and these alternatives emphasize the importance of a dynamic towards storytelling experienceas much as a dynamic text so that s it for me i ll stop sharing thank you so much for honoring that was really engaging and i m sure there ll be lots of things to stitch together between this and the next presentation and the previous one and so next up is rob gala who whose presentation is entitled from cinema and beta social media and be the changing face of video game characterization in the age of platform ization so we ll continue with the next presentation whenever you re ready all right thanks i m i m realizing full heartedly that i cut down my presentation to five minutes before i d read everyone s for papers and i think there are lots of kind of interestingareas of overlap here but maybe we ll have to leave it to the to the q a to bring some of those out definitely have time yet in the discussion yeah hopefully you can all now see my slides and and i want to talk about a particular example of transmedia storytelling from last year and in the summer of this is the period when this character of virtual influencer called serafina began building an audience on twitter on soundcloud and on instagram and you can see some of these accounts posts here and of course these accounts this character was fleshed out the character of an easygoing if anxiety prone aspiring musician with big dreams and acute pet cat and it was later in the year after this character been building a fan base for a few months that riot games revealed that they had created the character and that this character was joining the roster of their multiplayer online battle arena league of legends so this was a kind of launch campaign essentially for a video game character and the approach to storytelling here was obviously informed by the self branding strategies to quote duffy and horns and the small storytelling techniques to quote alexandrageorgia copper lou and that had been pioneered by young female users of social media platforms we could also of course draw parallels with well known projects like amalia omens instagram series excellent series imperfections that uses that platform to to spend what turned out to be a fictional story or breeds virtual influence little michaela and there was perhaps more direct influence in the fields of a woman called stephanie doris who in november i think it was wrote a medium post outlining her suspicion that right had essentially plagiarized her online persona to create this characterdetailing her short lyft relationship with a riot employee so whether or not they were taking inspiration from particular individuals and these are obviously the points of reference here for this mode of storytelling and i think this is an interesting change in many ways for an industry the commercial video game industry that traditionally has more readily look to hollywood script writers for kind of narrative inspiration so in the early s eric zimmerman accused video games are suffering from a bad case of what he called cinema envy for much of this period of the s the s commercial game is kind of aspired to this condition of interactive cinema and as recent blockbusters like the last of us pot to demonstrate plenty of games still follow this model and ellie the heroine of this gritty revenge saga is a character conceived according to traditional cinematic notions of plotting and characterizationwith dynamic developments or arc that leaves her irrevocably changed and these kinds of models of storytelling can work well for single player video games which players tend to buy up front much as you would in movie ticket or a blu ray disc and towork through challenge by challenge until they finished the plot and see the conclusion and in an agent platform ization however many of the most profitable video games including league of legends follow a different model league is a multiplayer gameto be played over and over online with others it s free to play and it makes its money through the sale of costumes or skins that transformed the look of the character and within the games fiction each skin is framed as another version of that character belonging to their own alternate reality in january tons terms these characters are conceived from the get go as transmedia figures right for reinvention and reimagining thus serafina can be both a training magician from a steampunk fantasy city and an aspiring indie musician posting selfies from a nondescript bedroom both versions of the character share a set of traits and visual signifiers that are supposed to kind of lend coherence across these different versions and there s obviously a very coherent palette to and the character of led by contrast is much lessmalleable and much less clear and legible you could if you so wish to buy a cutesy vinyl franco pop doll of her but i think this translation reveals that this really isn t a character designs to be reimagined in these ways to kind of real photo release visual style is quarter how she s meant to circulate and be received and i think in an age of platform ization as game developers seek to keep players attached to these properties and to keep them playing and generating data and what we may be seeing is less this convergence of film and games that was predicted in the early s and more a future that looks like serafina rather than la that s kind of the essence my argument so needed there great thank you so much rob i think it s really interesting to look at this gaze and this idea of envy and reciprocity and replication and mimicry between sort of reality and the online realm so that s going to definitely feel some interesting discussion and so we re onto our last presenter removing quite speedily but i m looking forward to the discussion that that will allow us to have so we re on to maria mentor who is presentation is entitled digital methodologies for analyzing and disseminating communityresearch societal cultural political ethics and perspectives so whenever you re ready maria feel free okay so now from fiction and influencers and social media and augmented reality we actually going to do not reality and this project digital realm i m going to be talking about certain methodologies that i developed in with my projects on community building and community research and oh sorry i got a problem with that okay so there you go so yeah so the same research on creative practices and research through electronic literature and it s something that i have been doing live for years now on practice based research and i mentioned in the paper how online platforms have taken a major role serving them and you know major roles are being mean to in during the coffee situation more variable yeah and we have been learning to do what we did before at a distance and in some cases even in isolation in as an artist and researcher in creative practices i have for a while now use sound such online platforms to create the spaces to share personal stories so the storytelling that i m talking about is more like life stories and i have been able to connect narratives to bring up issues of power territory displacement personneland historical memory gender and violence and so these are issues that i m interested in researching through electronic literature understanding electronic literature in a really broad way of life digital art or the fella storytelling you know in a poetry all these young girls that we re discussing here and so on and so yes now with them you know the copy global pandemic has made me father address the value that artistic practice it can have in our mental and psychological health any significance in community healing so this is something that i have become interested from some of the projects that i have done and also from the pandemic so this is a very new topic to me and a nice one of these strands and developed has developed from my recent works so how can we create meaningful projects that can have an impact in society this is what is the dream you know this is where i m driving for now you know by in so we have the idea of community and the co authorship in the co creative kind of maybe workshops that i ve been doing and this is the the idea of working with artists and communities at once and this has been developed in life in the project of invisible voices or in their workshop that we did yesterday on share to heal as well and which they were focused on associate associate associate all issues which occurred you to a specific as social or political circumstances have a period in time and they address questions in connection to communities histories the value that creative storytelling and artistic approaches come half in sharing personal stories and the value of working directly with participants so the paper also highlights the impact these projects can have not only to these specific communities but also to society in general so okay so i also these guys a little bit there and then internet as a medium and as a platform for communication and dissemination you know we net are to internet art but you know in a way comparing it with the media technologies nowadays which are more ingrained in our lives are saturating our dependence on online communication the way we experience our everyday life communicate interact and understand the socialthe cultural itself through the they need some media which some of these projects obviously are also presenting so coming make it even more imperative to think of new ways to build applications where users can share personal stories concerns mentalhealth problems challenges or social issues through narrative methods and media our practices so community research is the point here and building communities and sharing stories through digital creative practices we did this on the workshop yesterday with the initials market we created this platform where we could share a story and then the button the stories will be shuffled and the participants will get stories to heal you will have to create digital media project to create that way to heal that story and and so again it was about community building and creating meaningful conversations we had a little bit of problem with technology but we managed to actually get to those meaningful conversations in the end and this is their platform and this is where you actually get the story here and and then in these other kind of window you re able to write the digital media project i do you know to heal their story that you ve been allocated okay so these are just some of the i ve thought i just put these images in here i m not going to go through all these but these are just examples that i discuss in their in their essay as well and i have to say that they say say will change quite a lot because i will be focusing more on the methodology and i m using some of the material for something else anyway but this again is like when you go to the website documentary of the project which is personality story based on the spanish civil war then we have this have made your story you got themarchive and all those stories that are in them submit your story and in the archive they re also part of the deployment that digital media or electronic literature if you want a boy and these kind of methodology that i ve been using and of course the nice all the discussions are through the presentation some people that have also turn out from different places that were the standards of the winnebago passengers as well these are series of methodologies that you can see that paper in terms of life stories and your lambert and so on and then also with invisible voices this is one of the recent projects and this is i was working with women victims of the colombian conflict and with a community groups so squad with the pacifica so i these guys these more on their on their paper as well and i do have time to read it but again there was the aim of giving voice to the women victims to their participation their construction of memory and then there was the you know through ada digitaltechnologies but also a face to face and this methodology of co creation was something that we were using and this idea of urban design is based on our libertarian relationship between the signers and potential users and not on our rationale one in which in the designer is seen as our superior okay so this is where he was leading their workshops and then also the working with participants the different consideration of methods for that but that is specific context in the multi modality is they are they are you know the use of the app as wellfor them to share their stories in different multimodal ways through video video or written manner as well and then why storytelling this is again a methodology that is being used now in public health community based participatory research and practice which we used as well and i m here at the workshop is that you can have one day you can have a look on their website that i put on the chat and these were the outcomes you know which is including all kinds of things because in the website you have his life shows installation so there s stories videos and and then he s the digital art work which is like a summary of the whole thing and and then it s the application as well so yeah i m nearly finished there with them there is a whole series of audio recordings be the documentation so and then digital art which is divided in three different areas and also in the essay i haven t actually gone through the whole thing in terms of the metaphor that i ve been using as well to develop these work in and then this idea of the impactthat our practices have perhaps as killing methodologies and with the some feedback with with women and for instance from the point of view of co creation is this they felt that they have this emotion and joy of seeing their work of art come to life and and they said i say my my work of art because they felt like that so that was quite interesting to be able to you know to make them feel part of it and then also with the model on mr media online digital platforms again they also by enjoy workingwith their perhaps the same topics in many different ways that make suddenly in mixed media practices yeah because they thought that using all the senses the healing aspect is more intense and accurate and then just the last thing as well is that how through are they felt they were also giving voices to those who have no voices and and do we need through art was less painful okay so i m going to leave it in there have to really russia is very much maria that s great and so if you could remove the screen share that will be great and we ll move into the questions for anyone listening who hasn t been presenting if you d like to type your question into the chat please do so and if you want to ask it yourself of course you re free and encouraged to unmute yourself and ask your question but if you could just pop the q into the chat and then we ll try and avoid overlap by doing that and i have loads of questions but i ve done that thing where i ve written so much that i can t find my questions that i was writing as i went along but one thing that struck me which i thought was worth abusing my privilege of moderator to ask was that idea of what s at stake between the individual and the collective so how do we gain or lose from a sort of installing oneself within an online communityand i think that s particularly pertinent in hannah s and maria s work the idea of entering a dialogue that becomes representative of oneself there is an element of loss and an element of gain in that and subscription to an online community and i wonderedif that would maybe prompt any further reflections or ideas from either of you have had that sort of em almost dialogue between individual and community expression comes into play in your work yeah something you want me to start sure maybe hannah was from having just presented will do a little inverse perfect i would like the pathfinders like us people in a little probably know there was sort of a first a project like eight nine years ago now where the author would come in and explain things about their work but also different readers would be there and you would have the film experience ofthose reader so that s very individual but because you have several people it does show different examples and it does give you more of an experience like it incorporates the idea that document in the experience is part of documenting the work especially if the work is lost and since then and i ve explained this further in like the longer version of my article but since then this practice of the reversals especially has developed with a lot more work that are presented in the same way but also moving this reversalsfrom doing it in a studio to doing it publicly so there have been a bunch of reversals that happened at for example in the yellow conference and i think acm and different places where there was a public presence while this was happening and it became more of a communal experience with the people in the room and then obviously over the past year it has also turned digital which changes the experience a bit because it s an important element of reversals normally that it s on the original machines that it was the work was made on so for assume that s a bit different there had to be like an emulation of it but then also people can join in and watch it so it s turned from julian like the documentation in the studio to this social and performative practice right great that s a really rich answer thank you so much and maria i guess the notion of the collective comes into play very much in terms of solidarity building and healing as something that is shared rather than individual so that transition from individualssuffering to maybe healing as a collective vehicle is interesting in terms of your work yes and as well as assign presented in the different the slides you can see country yes i did anyway yes i did anyway i m looking forward to my yeah so nobody was like what he says in the case of the point across the atlantic it was interesting that i started doing the project without really knowing much about the community and then i land through the online platform and their stories and i learned about it you know so it was a very different way to the world with that we men were you know you are enough physical space and you re developing the work and then is there the idea of taking these work completing on online and which you know talking about experience as well and i think that if we had only done the workshops and experience everything through the friend and mixed media works that we need is a completelydifferent thing to actually then you know wasn t those videos was enhanced by actually see it online as well and then they they could feel like they were part of them get there were all sorts of the work anyway so they gave them this agency andempowerment in a way you know to see their work online and the fact that that was going to be distributed and published and you know many other people were going to be able to see that instead of just staying in the confines of a workshop thank you so much and i can see a really good intersecting question so i m going to just kind of cherry pick that here christine works has written in the chat maria how do the colombian women feel about their stories being available on the web platform did you are they anonymize them and i think i think you ve already answered that to a degree that it was an empowering factor as opposed to the loss of anonymity sort of was offset by the gain of the empowerment of sharing that story and having a platformfor still is still has to be anonymize yeah because of their problematic or putting a name towards our story so so that s that s how they feel they their homes that christine yeah so they fell yes empower done yeah with agency and they felt that they were the author says yes what i was actually explaining it right so that sense of self you want one thing that is important is that they felt that they they were actually taking part in the historical memorywhich in fact they were completely you know they are they doesn t exist in in history you know what has happened to them the troubles that they have gone through and everything and in that way they they felt that they were actually writing history in a different way yeah brilliant thank you so much and i will jump next to carlotta who has hundreds to i imagine is possibly asking an interesting question also so we ll stayon team and then we ll move to the next person who has a number of questions as well hi i m oh i m i m in a room where the talk is being projected um yeah i ended up feeling like my question was a bit too specific for the general conversation that was happening so i lowered my hand so you can feel free to skip over me oh that s no way even if you want to continue asking that s okay too specific questions are already know it s okay thank you perfect so we ll jump next to dina would you prefer if i read out your questions or would you like to ask them yourself basically my put my questions boil down to everyone how do you see these platforms in helping authors tell their life stories in what is one major advantage to each of your platforms that is present in this technology that s not present in oh say penand paper thank you that s a huge question i can maybe start sure yeah so there s a lot of answers to this but i ll try to narrow it down a bit not so much maybe about pathfinders but the scalar is also used for different types of stories and i am also doing sort of a parallel project will pose it uses an academic platform that it s meant for but also how is it used as a platform for brooksaffiliates and their choice to use an academic platform so there are various creative works for example stephen wingate has made daddy labyrinth which i m not sure if people are familiar with but at this a digital memoir that s made on platform on scalar and this is usedfor a lot of performances he came to know the platform from an elo conference and he thought this is like my member i need to use this i ve been struggling for decades with how to write this and now i can do it because it s multi linear and everypiece in scalar can be part of a path but you can also make it part of several parts the same piece of text so you can start reading at a certain point and have different texts that make sense after each other move to a next path and at a certain point your earlier runs come back again so then it is helping sell life story not just have the chronology of what happened but alsohow memory works how things come back several ways within different contexts which is also how research work so it s this overlap between doing the research and having to experience so that s one answer to it there s a lot of ways that you can use multimodal model and multi linear elements of scalar but i think this might be most of what you were looking for here that s great thank you and i noticed as well i know you had your hand raised earlier if you wanted to as you re already unmuted maybe if you wanted to add in a question that you may have i have like a sort of a bigger question for both about surfing and about wallace and gromit so i can do that later after people have answered this question ok let s continue with other people who may want to come in with a question we were just on i would guess this maybe speaks to what maria was saying where in her case this platform has kind of ethics and security at its heart it sounds like from the paper whether it s encryption whether it s giving people the right to withdraw stories they veshared you re very concerned with the terms on which people are visible and to take instagram as as a kind of contrary example where maybe to take specific that instance of someone who rightly or wrongly felt that their image been kind of appropriatedor plagiarized a platform like instagram whether or not we want to see it as helping one of the things central to it is the feedback mechanisms that allow people to kind of calibrate and tune how they present themselves to see what get some responsewhat gets likes what gets comments so i think that dimension has to be sort of taken into account and i think it s often pernicious rather than helpful but with marie s project i think we can see a real contrast about what a platform for sharing storiesmight look like if those questions of ethics and community where the heart rather than the kind of competition for attention and the desire to make spreadable content i think that s really interesting and if i may jump in there with just kind of a not quite yet formulated question it kind of speaks to a lot of the kinds of ideas that i m going to present on on friday in them work that i m doing at the moment and refugeenarrative and how content created by and four people on the move pops into platforms like instagram and almost passes completely unnoticed as the result of the way in which the platform is set up to privilege certain kinds of content and so i was thinking in both romans and rob s presentation this idea of pleasure and ludic so something that sort of really propels forward the success of games or narratives or a persona as the case may be and whether that as you say that idea of feedback and this growth in response to popularity rather than in response to kind of what has informed the projection of that story or that persona whether that kind of appetite on the other end that creates that kind of suction effect then sort of promotes a whatever it may be content on social media or a game or its popularity and how that sort of distortion can be dealt with and as well just to kind of intersect that with the idea of activism and empowerment and healing as potentially pleasurable practices as well and kind of along the lines of how adrian murray brown and conceives of pleasure activism real whether thatidea of healing and community building and empowerment can be sort of brought forward and disseminated on that basis you know and made to the idea of appeal is very problematic when we re looking at serious content in inverted commas as opposed tomore an image based or more pop culture sort of content so i wonder whether that gives us something to think about in terms of the way in which lewd acts and pleasure drive drive the privileging of content in online space sorry that was extremely long and rambling i can see bronwyn has hundreds so be great to hear from you yeah i wanted to talk a little bit to dennis question as well in terms of your question it s it s a big question and just a point i d say i think experience is potentially transformational that s been the principle of a lot of spontaneity work and and it then that can be easily scaffold by linking it to gain space for learning strategies you know because then you have the transformative experience and then you have other processes in place to help process that into a type of insight so the experiential fun element playful element allows people to step outside their everyday conditioning and start to touch a new insight through a direct kinesthetic experience so that s one value of it in terms of mobiles in terms of the platform getting back to the next question so that s one value of it in terms of mobiles in terms of the platform getting back to this question of mobiles because originally with this brief that were given the option to do vr or ar and they chose ar because you know vr is like you re very kindfrom south america to call in and tell their stories about corruption on a mobile phone and just call in and like a really a number and that was a way to really access people who wouldn t normally they haven t phone they don t have a computer theyhave a phone and and actually the studies have shown that mobile phones generally used by a lot more different ethnicities as well it s not just usual subjects you know it s kind of like the access of choice even if it s shared by people youknow it s it s a tool for access and related to that as well in terms of it s like a portal into the every day you know particularly a way of transforming the everyday experience using technologies like ar now technologies like a i think i agreewith the dena they re not really accessible to the general author and what my you know strong impression in this project was how technologically informed it was and how important the technology was to the process and and it was an expensive processas well and the other thing with mobiles is you can you can develop an app and next thing they update the apple s operating system and it doesn t work anymore so there is some real issues there with with the technology and in general for most authors working independently i d recommend working with an established platform that they worry about the the updates and you re just making progress and contentthat s going to keep working on that on that platform however having said that i think there s just so much value in mobile as a as a medium of expression and in terms of the value of for authors it s the same sort of value of going to transmedia as opposed to just writing on paper and i don t discount the value of just writing on paper there s a lot of value to that and pleasures in reading stories thatare written but there s also a lot of additional enhancements to be gained from visual media or experience or media or data and all these sorts of things that can come in a systematic context so it s transforming the writing absolutely and it s new that s an interesting process and it there are you know it s about finding the ways to do it in a way that s accessible but certainly i d say mobiles and very accessible platform hope that s answered your question both question does just back to romans point uh one of the things that we ve been talking about particularly in the right pads in the salons is how so many developing countries are exploring all things are readers are exploring electronic literaturethe possibility of multi strand stories and telling their life stories and getting that support so it s it talks to all of your points and they re leapfrogging over the computer age into the mobile phone age because that s the technology that s availablepractically everyone has a mobile phone practically no one has a computer or internet access so it s it s it s key i think thank you yeah i could just say something if it if anybody unless there s somebody that wants to talk maria no it s just from where we lead also the application these are up you know for the women to be able to actually live their life stories well that was the fact that they were able to communicate in different ways you know whether they wanted to leave a video which they are actually really used to it now again it was an easy way to share their life story in that way and also being anonymous anyway and then also they could also live over the years which again they re really familiarized with and and they could write it as well but you know writing some of them were finally delegate more difficult so that s why it was important that accessibilitythat dina was asking is found in that multi modality you know in the way you know like the sentence that i had in there we explained the world we investigate all those other ways so so these these these multi modality as possible so they re kind of important in this project and we were doing clinics abilities mainly because i can make so many things that s a really interesting question as well the multimedia dimension and that idea of the audio message which i know is much more prevalent in the kind of latin american context was really valuable resource for people who might be daunted by the ideaof sort of writing out word for word their experience and i think there s also a really interesting kind of binary of sort of intimacy versus vulnerability and that idea did you feel it was important to really preface the project with a sense of the projects diffusion and to whom sort of the work would be disclosed and in what way sort of these narratives would be used because i think there s something very sort of intenselypersonal actually about speaking and audio message testimony almost into your own phone as if it s staying within your own sort of personal sphere and yeah i just wondered how you approach that idea of em in kamala know making space and making that space of diffusion sort of something to be interacted with preemptively yeah yeah well this was kind of quite a big project so we work with our whole group of people like the local impact coordinator in colombia as well and and it was very important to start with i could understand where these women were coming from you know and some of them had already been participating in workshops so so yeah you you have to be because it is this level of intimacy and yeah we needability you have to be like really careful in the way that i mean for me that was actually quite you know to start with i was worried about it you know is how am i going to actually be able to develop this project with them without victimize him thenagain you know so so you have to understand the group and that s why having other people that work with him before he really helped to be able to pose the right questions on the right dialogues and they were very very open to actually talk and sharetheir experiences so so yeah so that that yeah so in the end that s how we deal with it you know these kind of more interdisciplinary group of people researching this project i mean mainly concentrated on there you know on the kind of artistic side of it if you want i don t know if we downsize your chris yeah absolutely no i think it s that balance of putting the technology in place and putting the structure in place without over over determining the intentionality and allowing that kind of aspect of personal experienceto drive what happens thereafter and allowing it to be something that takes the form of it some of it into the computers yeah i sort of had a question that i guess is for hannah and bronwyn might not actually be a question but i m roman you talks about let s plays as a way of learning about the experience of people using the software and navigating these various differentelements and hannah obviously this idea of the traverse or in terms of lacking a language for these emerging forms that seems like a really valuable way of some of the same things that let s plays do what is the experiential dimension of this how ourare particular users navigating and activating what s here so i wondered i mean essentially i just like to hear both of you say a bit more about that and i wasn t sure particularly for broadway and whether these were part of the iterative design processwhether things were being tweaked on the basis of how players were responding or whether this is you reflecting on on how it s been received and interesting you mentioned that rob actually let s plays words so much a part of user experience studies and user testing was a big part of the development process but i tend to use let s plays increasingly in my own research and i just find them such an invaluable resource and it was interesting going back to some of the points susie question susie was raising about you know where s the authenticity in this pool at the same time for sociality and attention and attention economy and it s very hard it s very hard actually susie to find them this you know let s play that i ve been studying a merger of performance and construction in the everyday and casualness you know so it s reflective of the everyday culture but it clearlya conscious construction at the same time but i find them such a really valuable resource it s interesting you mentioned that rob i use them a lot increasingly i guess i m thinking about this question of pleasures and which ones are kind of measurableunderstandable as well because i mean i think you talked about agency and how obviously providing choices gets difficult logistically but sometimes it s i think sarah stone calls it interpretive agency that people find meaningful just their own experienceof navigating the content yeah that s so true i haven t i haven t sort of looked in depth for the term interpretive agency but i really liked the sound of it i ll have to look into that a little bit more yeah and i think it s as you say it s theevent i was talking about it in terms of valuation because i was thinking of it in terms of taking that step forward and then using your evaluation or your interpretations or then expressed and it kind of becomes part of the feedback loop in some waysas well and let s plays also part of a dialogue because there s a in christ culture because they broadcast live remember and there s quite a culture of people chatting underneath it and interestingly a lot of them will refer to other let s plays like so and so play this like this and you re doing it like this so they obviously watched quite a few different lets players who might have followers of over million age so there s almost like an internal referencing system at play on all of these platforms and i think that is really interesting is when we think about serafina when we think about and perform activity on the platform as coming from experience of the platformand that kind of prior phase of maybe not quite conditioning but engagement that s something that prefaces one s kind of more more assertive sort of engagement and that idea of prior knowledge and i wonder whether that s something that feels and jarringwhen we contrast content such as sort of influencer professionalism versus a project like maria s which works with the community on a much more earnest basis of story sharing and then more perhaps honest kind of sense of testimony and depiction ofthe everyday because i remember i m looking at the moment at the idea of how communities are articulated online and how that feeds into kind of mimicry and as well that almost sort of co creates that precedent online co creates communities mimicking theonline version and so that idea of sort of having having a precedent and mimicking what is understood from the platform s own kind of prior uses is something that i think that loop is really compelling i think i ve lost myself in my own loop i was just saying i m cautious of saying that one s more authentic than the other only because i think performance is embedded in them in the everyday people perform any way yeah whether it s for an audience of million i mean the ones who are doing it to an audience over million or more polished but i wouldn t wouldn t wouldn t expect that other people even if they were out of that context and doing a community thingwe re conditioned and performative yes the only thing i d say that would that would be my my my question around that yeah maria has her hand raised yes i want it i just want to ask rob and i thought your paper was fascinating you know with this idea of the game remediated in social media and it s not something that i have been you know looking at or anything so so i wonder if you want to say something you know to elaborate a bit about these kind of getting these characters from different contexts and whether then it seems like it s something which is more common idea is the way that a games are going atthe moment yeah these remediation of their social social media instead of their filmic and but yeah now i really enjoy reading all this story about this influence side that it wasn t real and i know this aspect of this subject and subjectivity southerneveryone to say something on that sure i think in that case there s there is a pleasure that comes from some of this blurring of genres and expectations is it fake or is it real you can enjoy the patent faintness of the virtual influence but also of course one of the pernicious things about influencing culture is that that blurring of boundaries allows for content that might seem sort of spontaneous and personal but it s actually branded and calculated to be to be shared and but yeahi guess i was interested in the extent to which the kind of economic imperatives and the economic context that makes certain forms of storytelling and characterization viable that maybe don t always get recognized so in a context of platform ization where keeping people in the platform generating data interacting with one another is important and i think a move towards this kind of small storytelling where you have possibly a more intimate lowest stakes relationshipwith characters who don t change dramatically but who kind of develop over time is something that seems to becoming more common and i guess actually some of the really good literature on this is by city area and scott last you talk about wallace and gromit actually as examples of this and about how that that series plays with a certain sense of technicality and materiality which is also one of the pleasures of the serafina account as shots of this virtual hand holding up a virtual polaroid of what purports to be the character wasa child so there s a play with kind of the material and immaterial that it s it s also part of the pleasure again this idea of a personal stories as well and i was thinking how could i even think of doing a project like you know like that with if you think about because i thought how is my whole project please feel real connected to you know to social media and these kind of fictional characters that are already there as influencers and they are no even really influences on how would you actually be able to perhaps use that with the women that i ve been working with you know will kind of ethical problemscreate or will they perhaps enjoy you know being influencers and so i didn t talk about potentially much more artistically interesting games and interactive pieces that i m playing more critically with the performances of digital platforms and talk aboutdynamics of kind of revelation and secrecy and there are there are games that are doing that for in more of a kind of artistic context than a commercial one so perhaps i should have alerted everyone to those instead that s really interesting though rob where where s the line you know i think there s a really interesting kind of set of signifiers going on that kind of signal that one is more sort of commercial and one is more artistic and i really like that ideaof the digital those often where we fall into the blurring of the battery or the fuzziness of the boundary between the two and so i d be really intrigued on a program that one that s not a sort of an order to speak for i really liked your point i really liked your points about the pleasures of materiality and the pleasures of the fuzzy genre itself and i wonder how they how you see them looking to i mean i can see them linking it back to the pleasures of evaluation and the pleasures of kinestheticperfect as well and have to get the reference from you about the one about the materiality of wallace and gromit thank you for that that s really helpful maybe i could use this associated to ask canada serbian more because i think that thing of the materiality ofthe old computing hardware that you might need to authentically play classic electronic literature now but also that question of the reversal was a genre is really interesting i d love to hear a bit more about that i definitely like an important part of pathfinders and this approach and it was also something that came up when i did the reader to reversals that they would come to first just see it happening on the screen that admittedly it s like an old screen forand watch the videos but then move on to the documented materials which is photos of all the physical materials that you needed to have when you were going to play this work with one descriptions alongside it to explain everything and one of my readers wasn t mean oh i wasn t expecting this to be physical but that makes sense because it s from pre web so you needed to have something and then like getting really into these photos and things and just having like a card that sets like in the description i think it s up there s a registration card and she was like what s the registration cards and then scroll through to find the picture of the registration parents and description of it and try to imagine what it was like to haveto use that and why would we think it s important and all those kinds ofdiscussions around death so definitely to even like in the digital book the metric empathy is very important and hannah also something that you mentioned is the publication you know this the academic publication in connection to the method that they ve been using but find us as well in i wonder if you want to say anything else about it oh yeah sure i m not sure what what direction release that well i think he s yes he s just he s a major thing in a way you know i mean like practitioners if we when we are in academia you know i think that if you re a practitioner doesn t matter how many kind of our work so whole digital media works you do if you don t have like written publications he doesn t seem to count yeah so that format you know it s still yeah no people like being progressive like because they wrote a physical book and also had a digital book there they do different things but it s coming from the same research project and the physical book is from mit press she s like well do you have like mit press especially in our field that s like the brass ring that opens everything whereas with pathfinders now it s like a canonical book as i introduced it like if i talk about born digital publications with other people that find this is the first one they re like oh right i ve heard of that but sd me explain it s a a court respect over time and it doesn t have this automatic blessing along with it but it s just like the beginning of it whenit s also about how you use it like i said one of my readers said like oh yeah in film studies we have video essays which used to not be taken seriously as academic work and now they re more and more seriously and then without like me prompting anything to remove them but i don t think that video essays get cited a lot so that s like the other part of the institutional embedding gross citation isn t important i don t want to say currency because it s so transactional but that s how it things become part of the conversation so several of the readers acted like wonder like if i would say this how would i say that what media we decided we decided that the book would it be important to took the photos when i m referring to the images and then there s all these little things that seemingly don t matter to themselves but there are very importantto like this academic context that s great that s really interesting and that idea of a sort of implicit list of qualifications that you kind of need to be always crossed yeah encountered we don t have quite the fluidity that we feel we should have sometimes in terms of breakinginto new media forums ofcan i ask a follow up question about that too because you said in your paper that optimum writing styles can vary across media and at the same time there s this increase of convergence media to think speaks to the physician where she just talked about and i was wondering if you can explain more about how media expectations are still in some ways fulfilled and in other ways suffered it in these multimedia convergence experiences well good good good question i think it s a flux and i think it s hard it s hard to generalize because it can change according to the context because the relationships are very contextual and certainly you know because if you think that captions it s the effect of that is it s it s contextual with the page and it s about relationships but certainly you know because i used to work across different media platforms and we we would see the different writing styles and it was well known that maybe some people could write for radio and not for print because there were different writing styles and theywould find it hard to go across but then if you move into the transmedia realm you know it becomes an entity is conversational it depends on what s the caption and what color is the caption on the page and what what is this what is its function is it to impart information or is it for effect or is it to be a bit more conversational so i m not sure that i can really answer your question in as much detail as you d like because i think because i am sorry oh sorry sorry for now that you re answering the question i m wondering if maybe it s more about than the production side than the reception side that s darko versions as long as all the different people are there to do the specific things they re goodat it becomes the one experience but then you always need like the groups of people that you would meet for wallace and gromit them for sarah free to work on these types of projects which would require a lot of resources again um yeah i think if you if you do have specialists it really really helps and certainly in the in the behind the scenes process in wallace and gromit it was coordinate they developed over the time they developed languages to be able to speak betweeneach other and they would actually be looking at and checking in because there was different understanding of terms between the different specialisms and they would be developing that you know even at the start when they were working with them andthey would sort of taught start to talk about the developing store in terms of beats which is not something they normally did in the in the tech space you know so they were sort of learning to be agile in their communication styles anyway but within that they they had specialisms they were had very clear cut specialisms so it is about this to and fro as well listen to and it s a it s a this is a challenge isn t it to define it because i think it s almost it is about reception as much as a production because the production is informed by the reception and the reception is informed by the production sorry continue well i i have previously advocated that we need a new term that s a bit more of a neutral term and that we can hang these markers on but that doesn t that just hasn t ever taken off there s just know tim and so in the meantime these way marketing them seem to be particularly helpful the double barrel that s great and there are a lot of kind of hybrid terms that are pending for a lot of the kinds of concepts and ideas we ve been discussing today i think and i don t like to cut the panel short i feel like it s just a plant that s growing all thesereally interesting runners and the fruit is kind of in the making so thank you all so much for a fascinating discussion i m just more than anything flagging the time to let you have a break between now and the next discussion but i look forward to chattingwith you and sort of working together in this funny interconnected format as the conference goes on and over the coming days and thanks to all of our speakers today and to everyone for you brilliant questions and we ll wrap up here for now but i m surewe ll be talking in between now and the end of the conference so thank you all so much again
