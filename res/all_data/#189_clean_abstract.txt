 while covid may have fractured our public private and professional narratives of normalcy out of this slow moving and surreal catastrophe new images of the future imaginary began to emerge as well as new creative practices for collaborative re imagining the digital literacy centre is a collective of researcher academic artists at the university of british columbia who are interested in exploring innovative approaches to literacy digital media research and experimental methodologies for technologically enriched meaning making practices and collaboration like everyone in the world each of us in the dlc experienced the pandemic individually as a diffracted and intensely intimate encounter and yet also collectively as a shared story one that we were narrating together in real time however virtually we decided to take up this evolving pandemic moment as a technological and creative research challenge to engage with the innovative digital platforms at our disposal towards collaborative futures imagining during a time of crisis skunk tales is the result a multimodal collaborative futures fiction that we wrote composed sonified and performed in chapters that map an imagined future of human interactions with literate technologies in this paper we describe a collaborative technologically mediated storying methodology that enacts the diffraction patterns that arise when specific aural experiences are rubbed against specific narrations of human technological coupling cecchetto p during our storying sessions we simultaneously sonified the emergent narrative data using singling a text to midi musial instrument digital interface linguistic data sonification software we developed singling for the sonification and visceralization of textual data in qualitative research and analysis capable of sounding discrete characters symbols and punctuation as well as word forms in lexicogrammatical categories of english language texts singling transforms text into user determined soundscapes as we wrote skunk tales we invited the emergent soundings to permeate the futures imagining and become entangled with the movements of the narrative as cecchetto argued it is precisely the forceful quality of sound that makes it an agent of modulation that can help to amplify certain elements of narratives of human technological coupling making them audible p this paper maps our creative futures research generation that is informed by technological posthumanism and how different technologies of text production suggest different models of signification initiat ing new experience of embodiment and embodied experience interacts with codes of representation to generate new kinds of textual worlds hayles p sound permeates the methodology and the resulting diffracted narratives both theoretically materially and thematically elo we first began the narrative face to face in the early days of the pandemic and then diffracted outwards into social isolation and virtual jam sessions we extended the narrative beyond the limits of our collective and into a storying performance at the artful inquiry research group virtual conference during which we wrote and sonified a chapter live in virtual space as such skunk tales is a pandemic tale sounding the evolution of a future now receding into the past while simultaneously signifying new possibilities for dynamic arts based conversations between subjectivities technologies sounds and meanings
