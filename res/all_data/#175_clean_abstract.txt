 i propose to share with the elo community the story of the rise and fall of the adventure game toolkit agt a pascal based design system written in by david malmberg based on mark j welch s generic adventure game system gags it was the leading platform for parser based interactive fiction in the late s and early s with text adventure development system tads as its upstart competitor the use of these early pre graham nelson s inform design system parser based interactive fiction platforms was supported by an annual agt contest and a design community that stayed in touch through bbs communities the largest of which was compuserve s gamer s forum malmberg ceased to support agt in the final release was agt but the contest continued until after which it elo was rebranded and continued on as the interactive fiction competition which has been run since by the interactive fiction technology foundation a game that i wrote for the agt contest in cosmoserve featured a simulated dos environment featuring the frustrating use of dial up software and the aesthetic of compuserve screens from that era as well as the more visceral experience of bbs communication wailing modems paying by the minute long download times and corrupt files hard drive destroying viruses etc ironically this game is now all that appears to be left of compuserve s rich gamers and game designers lifeworld a collaborative work that i organized shades of gray an adventure in black and white written in agt was designed and coordinated in a compuserve gamer s forum private room and represents the heyday of bulletin board if collaboration ironically when compuserve died in the mid s after having been assimilated in a borg like way by its longstanding and hated rival aol nothing of compuserve remained to be archived digitally except what individual users might have downloaded to their own computers and backed up on floppy disks i will soon be launching through iftf a crowdsourced digital archeology project asking old users of compuserve forums chiefly gamers and science fiction forums the two places that gamers and game designers hung out to go into their own basements and see what they can find of media they might have downloaded from compuserve in its final years this includes transcripts of conferences listings and files from libraries public postings and private email i will share the history of agt as a e lit platform its code games contest and disappearance from the scene i ll also give an update on the compuserve gamer s forum digital archeology project particularly as our finds shed light on the life and times of writers of e literature and interactive fiction who used early platforms like gags agt and tads to write and share their work uploading and downloading it to and from bbs services it is a world that has vanished from the digital record in my paper and presentation i ll try to bring some of it back
