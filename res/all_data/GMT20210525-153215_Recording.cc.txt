stewart for your great work now let s continue question a comment in the chat about turning the live captions on can somebody who can somebody do that let s see if i can run now everyone can do it also think wonderful now i will mention that these board vacancies the board of directors is in conversation about how it wants to fill these board vacancies we have retreats in july where we will address these matters and then one of the the requests from the communityhas been to get the community more involved in the selection of board of director members this requires potentially some changes to our bylaws which will be considering our retreat in july but whether we make changes to the bylaws in this matter or or not we still want to get more community inputs and involvement in deciding who s onthe board of directors the budget i m not going to go into a numbers breakdown but i mentioned that we have three main funding sources membership is our number one from the source so the membership that you all pay supports the organization and supports the its initiatives we do have an institutional partnership with washington state university in vancouver that ends next year we also receive donations usually targeted to specific initiatives such as some of the yellow awards some of that yellow fellows etc most of our budget about of our budget goes towards administrative costs we have holly slocum as our administrative assistant who dedicates about hours a week to working with the yellow matters and we have other costs that come with with being an organization about of our budget goes to elo initiatives which i will highlight with the help of the board now first of all our conferences we have been doing yearly conferences whether they re international i mean whether they re face to face or online this is our second online conference this is where community comes together we tend to see these conferences about to help them get started sometimes we recoup that sometimes we don t and that s part of the cost of operation i ll mention that we are considering to pre proposals for yellow for hybrid conferences i cannot provide more details at this stage but we will be announcing things as soon as decisions are made there the electronic literature directory which is overseen by joe tavi he asked me to read this brief statement he says we re presently working to extend our network of literary advisors in support of this carlo the entries that are fellows and other earlycareer scholars are bringing to the directory board approval is a key element of all year these entry submissions and they mean editorial board not yellow board of directors are descriptions of works encyclopedic essays and glossary entries on keywordsand concepts currently we have entries on our underway on it and post humanism a focus for a march post humanism conference in bergen norway the eld team welcome similar entries in response to our elaboration of scholarly papers and creative workspresented during the our hosts yellow this conference were in in support of this heightened eld activity we re expanding our network of reviewers for example members of each generation of yellow fellows are now being asked to review entries writtenby all yellow members any questions can be sent to eld managing editor and yellow fellow danny spinoza alright continuing the

careers so we have grad students and postdocs and tenure track faculty and artists that s really great and as you can see the topics are very exciting you have the list here and we we are very happy to be engaging deeply with next year s presidential theme which is multilingual journalism which is great for us but we re going to do it with from a few different perspectives so anyways anybody who has an emily may remember is welcome to attend and i hope to see you there so very happy about this thank you alex now the yellow awards honor are you here i didn t yes i m here i m here in my t shirt make conference t shirt yeah um hello everyone i have a great pleasure to be a convener for the yellow awards this year and as you probably know we have three words and you can see the particular categories here and i m so happy to be able to work with the grades jurymembers who whose names you can also see on the slide and i already know the decisions but i welcome you i invite you for the award ceremony in two days so i will share the news but i will make to emphasize that i think we ve got great nominations basically there was nominations in total nine nominations for major mary lou sabrina career achievement award nominations for and catherine has a word for the credit for criticism of electronic literature andstaggering nominations for robert coover award for the best work of electronic literature so the jury the jury did an excellent job and please join us on friday evening to hear the news thank you thank you now next up let s talk a little bit about equity diversity and inclusion initiatives and in in the yellow and i ll leave anastasia salter to talk a little bit about this well so this is the code of conduct that the board drafted and approved it s based on codes of conduct that we ve had at previous conferences as well as the geek feminism creative commons license to code which has been vetted by amused by a number of organizations across both academic and technical fields and thus represents a space that has faced similar similar challenges as our communities has at times we particularly wanted to kind of move forward on this as we re thinking about hybrid and potentially more virtual engagement as a common mode of expanding our community over the coming years so we hope that this will assist both conference organizers thinking about the system the future and set the guidelines for meaningful inclusive participation and the community going forward thank you so much and i will add that every month on first fridays or sometimes they happen on a second friday but every month i will be hosting a session called fbi in the yellow or we ll talk about these issues so you are all welcome to join and this is an ongoing work it is a consideration we re bringing into all aspects of what we do everything and know that you know some of that might come up in the discussion today but but in general we are working hard at at making the elo an organizationthat is equitable diverse and inclusive let s continue so i will end with with you know again i hope these initiatives help justify the membership most of the membership as i said of that goes right into these initiatives gets reinvested right into the field we do a lot of advocacy work and we help the the you know we help our colleagues we help grow the field we help nurture it we help have it you know for it to have memory and of course we have other initiatives we do publications we do archiving we do many things so whether you attended the conference or looking at this in a recording afterwards please consider joining the yellow supportingour activities with your membership and you know we look forward to having you as part of our our big family and now i ll open things up for the qa and for that i will stop sharing and leave caitlin fisher in charge i will not be able to remain for the rest of the discussion but i will be watching the recording and i will see you all a little later at the opening and in the conference thank you thanks leo enjoy the rest of the day and welcome everybody i do see a few new faces so if you re new to the hello a special welcome to you and otherwise nice to see so many friends here so i guess this is really the town hall moment where we can take questions from the floor you can put questions in the chat but we would love to hear what the membership has to say so this is your time you can use the little hand raise but i think i can also see your physical hands if you d like to participate that way well i think our initiatives you re clearly you re still thinking about all of the amazing yellow initiatives it s actually been a fantastic year for for new ideas to bring things to conclusion i m also going to just echo louise you know and take this moment while people are gathering questions to congratulate the organizing teams i ve been sort of more peripherally involved but there s so much work that has gone into the conference i almost i can t even really start to name start with with with soreness scott but there are so many you know jason was working like right up tolike that time and all these incredible posters eight different exhibitions anyway just been a fantastic labor and i know that they ll be a more full some opportunity for thank you later on at the opening but i wanted to begin by acknowledging that too so thanks on behalf of the yellow for everybody who took part in organizing the conference space we re in right nowjust zoom teaching no no anastasia was many people have their cameras on so it s not exactly like zoom teaching should have like all cameras off and one person in bed dina has her hand up dina over to you i apologize my private computer is the only one in the world without a webcam the others are government computers so forgive me but i did want to and i will put it in the chat say thank you guys so much for all of your initiatives as well on the code of conduct that you ve been doing and finding ways to include people this has been so important for people with handicap access around the world of financial issues as well sothank you for that the second tuesday salon had an incredibly active brainstorming session and i put it into the chat for inclusion solutions and i know the board is meeting on these and i hope that that initiative continues and that we can continueto reach out to people i also wanted to say personally i know that the pandemics been very difficult but having an online component has been life saving extremely important thank you guys so much for this and even if we can meet in person i do hope that we re planning on at least some online and the second tuesday salons every second tuesday am eastern standard time and anybody s willing ready to join we do have that going on for distance and accessibility it s been very fun thank you guys so much and shout out for doing what you do for inclusive city thanks so much for that comment and also for your your leadership you need amazing leadership around the salon and also for pushing us to to do better work all the time and just for being such an incredible number of the elo community other thoughts this is also a chance for you to you don t have to comment on any initiatives here just sort of like where you re at and ideas that the board can take back and think about as well andalso initiatives you might like to see i m just enjoying watching everyone be silent together it s our new meditative space at yellow where we just have time to refresh where you can book off of meetings at work just come here and do nothing so scott it s true it s actually it s quite nice if i could make one one suggestion that i did i mentioned to a couple of board members already which is simply that i would the the part of the code of conduct dealing with the conferences i would consider putting that into a separate document andjust because there s a couple of potential issues there one is that although it s great to have both online and in person conferences or the can be both it s it can be a challenging thing for conference organizers to to actually be challenged to do both of those things at the same time and that can also be it although it sounds like its inclusion airy that can also be exclusionary in the sense that there s a lot of institutions that would not be able to pull together the resources to do that and then the other aspect of that that i that i would really consider is although of course we want to make sure that we adhere to two best practices and in human rights and equality is that if we restrict ourselves if we say to two artists and twoinstitutions that we can t organize conferences in any country where any of these principles are being violated that s also going to say to you know to the artists and to the academics in countries where where these things are not adhere to certainlynorway s in a great position with this but in many other countries are not for example last year i think that the trump administration would have been in violation of many of those principles in the us and that would have meant that last year s conference could not have been held in orlando so there s a lot of these sort of details that that i think we can sort of rush to to these sorts of things and say that sounds like a great idea but i would encourage you to think those through carefully and then to consider separating those two documents so that one might be guidelines for conference organization or these are the things we would love to see in future conferences and then the other via via code of conduct and then the last thing that i would say about that is that i think as an organization and i m so glad that so many people stepped up from the yellow board you know it s especially single caitlyn and mark marino for and and also other people eric lawyer and claudia who s kind of came in and helped us out with a lot of stuff with the conference but i think in that statement of those guidelines that yellow should also articulate what its role will be cuz rightnow it says future conference organizers will be required to do this and this and this and just reading it from the perspective of someone if you want them to come in and organize a conference and with the first thing you do is give them a code of conductthat has at the very bottom of it these are conference guidelines preceded by don t violate human rights and all these ways i think you re going to pose some challenges to the organization in the future so i just wanted to you know to put that out there i know that it s it s a great initiative and i know that these things are often living documents but i would actually encourageyou to think carefully about revising that document thank you very much for that comment scott will take that back to the board for consideration i think a lot of our members are here right now other points either related to that issue or two other things that are on your mind either in response to our current initiatives or two initiatives that you d like to see there s quite a bit of discussion in the chat now aboutthe value of remote conferences minimizing travel potentially finding other ways to have some online events so i think there s a lot of creativity we could bring to finding the right the right balance here sorry yeah i just want to add into to what what what scott said by by saying basically we wouldn t have been able to to make both an online and and and and a physical conference that would have been impossible it s quite well actually doing a virtual conference is easier when it is virtual because you all have your own cameras you know if you do a physical conference you have to have a camera team which is you know a whole lot of other costs all we should think about other ways of being together because i m totally for finding ways that where we don t have to travel around the world once a year also for climate reasons obviously but but also to be inclusive thanks very much we have dina has her hand up again or is this from last time no this is another one but ok also i m mark marino has been developing a wonderful calendar that i can t access and there s so many online events and so many in personevents mark can you explain how that calendar works sure sure dana well like all of our communications we again it may lead to a little bit of a bottleneck but we prefer for members just to be out events just that send them my way i ll put them up on the calendar i m happy to do that just the same way i poured events and announcements to our email elolisser but if it if it makes it with that where is that calendar where s the what s the url you mean or where can you share the url for that calendar in the chat at least thanks yeah i ll put it so so the question was was you can t find the yellow calendar i m sorry i thought it was about posting to the yellow calm right well one i can t find it into how do people get events on the calendar yeah so i will post the link to the catalyst someone s there faster for me i ll put the link to the calendar in the discord chat and mark sample has a great suggestion that i ll let him talk about in a second if he wants to and then and then if you have any announcements have any events whatsoever just send an email and for anybody here you ve got a really captive audience i encourage everybody put your announcements in the chat right now and following this conference to will try to follow in support your events and initiatives i d also really encourage anybody who especially if this is your first yellow to introduce yourself in the chat i know not everybody wants to speak up at a town hall but we d love to know who you are and to make an effort to to connect with you over the course of the next couple of days yes absolutely check out the discord channel i think marks done an amazing job i think it was set up by last games last year marks continuing it at the moment it s very vibrant it tests of ebbs and flows but we re hoping to be able to to see a lot of you on discord other questions this is a very peaceful town hall we re all very zen here oh jeremy has a new book coming out later this year fantastic dina s announcing the salons congratulations jeremy congrats stina everybody had their presentations done i just raised my hand i guess i don t need to because it s so silent but i the question i kind of from a board member to the people who are on the board here but just to everybody in the community leo said earlier that you know we re thinking about different ways to change who sits on the board of directors so so right now basically the board of directors new members are are basically kind of vetted by current board of directors and there s there s a vote but there s been discussion among some board members about like maybe opening this up somehow so i m just curious while we while we re all here if if folks have other ideas or thoughts about how members to the board of directors or at least some numbers maybe not entirely the entire slate but some members of the board of directors might be kind of coming from the community anything like that and you know any thoughtsor is it working just fine right now one thought i know what some organizations do is that they when they have you know separate board of directors in the in the corporate structure that that the yellow has as a c three nonprofit organization i know that what some organized organizations do would be to have some slots on the board that are nominated by by the organization s general membership and then still approved by the board of directors and i think in the case of the elo i m familiar with the bylaws of the yellow because i wrote with a lawyer a long time ago but but that would still be within the current bylaws of the of the elo for example to have members at large that are nominated by the lo community and then sort of simply approved by the board of directors yeah that s great scott that idea has come up before and one thing i want to kind of point out i guess some of us know and some of us don t and i don t even know the entire entirety of the legal ramifications but you know we are a legal entity withlegal status so there are certain things we can do in certain things we can t do without involving lawyers when it comes to change in our bylaws are operating so that s something just in case anybody s thinking why don t you just kind of wave your hand and start doing something differently sometimes they re kind of legal reasons that we cannot just change the way we operate this is a great discussion to have also pointed out to that most board members have been active members of the community it s not like we draw from somehow mysteriously outside of our membership most people nominated have been you know within the thefolds of the elo and are nominated that way but i think this is something that it s good to have a lot a number of options and and ways of working to make that feel like like the process is not so opaque and so we ll definitely be considering this i just want i see your hand in it you ll be next i just want to shout out someof the things in the chat we have oh it s all come up there s so many things that are happening someone just finished their thesis sam is here from india first time at yellow so check the chat there thank you nice to meet you roberta s thesis on italian electronic literature is coming up november so congratulations for that and carlotta is is new and has been helping behind the scenes with the conference fantastic and someone else s mentioned the lab the literaryadvisory board and that s also a fantastic way where people can be making contributions from our community it s been relatively inactive for the last little while but we have plans for activating it and all of the you know the incredible resource that we have out there so danny then stephanie i see a hand now one thing i ll say about board i joined in and it takes a lot of time so one of the things to think about if you re interested in being on the board is the amount of time commitment it takes if you re going up for tenure if you re trying to finish a dissertation this is not the time to be on the board but certainly we want people that are very active in the community that want to contribute their time and energy all of us on one thing you ll you ll also learn is that we we do not take money from the yellow so board members are not paid to do any of the work we do we re all volunteers so we fly to a conference and we do something it s usually it s always out of our own expenses so it does take a little bit of energy and time commitment to be on the board but certainly welcome anyone who s interested thank you stephanie yes i was gonna say along the same lines that it s a working bored not an advisory board nobody just advises and the amount of work is very much you can t always tell we ve had an extremely busy spring work and the amount of hours for consultingit was required we also pay for our own to belong to the year and to pay conference tues so there s no perks for being on the board other than wonderful company by people who really care about the field and you know really do their best and weanyone who was interested to that degree we d love to hear from you and if you would like to be part of the literary advisory board and with there s a number of things we would like such people to do a joe would like people to write descriptions forthe yield descriptions of of email it works and which there s you know so many that we d like to learn more about and have described and become part of literature where they can be studied by other people but other things too i mean we have places to show installations of work and to post conference many many things that would be wonderful so please and you know caitlin if people do want to express an interest is that is there some should they be writing mark i mean what s the way to express it what s a direct way for someone to express an interest that they might have anything we have one formalmechanism i would invite anybody here if you re seriously considering that you would like to be more active or be involved in a leadership or in the literary advisory board in some way to contact any of the board members who are here and we can be you know we can work on getting back to you and if it s not an immediate action item if it s sort of like you know interested in being put forward at some other time we might not immediately get back to but we will keep that running list i think itwould be amazing to find out who s interested in doing this work because we re constantly seeking renewal mark give a better maybe everyone contact no no i don t know i don t have a better answer they can contact anyone on the board no i wouldn t say a couple things the first one is again this this thanks to our organizers and congratulations on putting together a fantastic conference i mean this is i ve beenattending conferences for over years and this is the most extraordinary one i ve ever been a part of where there are eight eight international art exhibitions there are multiple continents that are actually hosting events for this conference and there are over people in attendance is just extraordinary to me i have not seen anything like this ever the second thing i want to say is if you have an event that you would like elo to be a co sponsor of we have a mechanism for you to request our sponsorship now sometimes that sponsorship comes in the form of my job just communication so we ll help amplify you will put it out on all of our channels will get people to in their zoo seats are in there in person sees if we can help in any way with that so that s one thing we can do and then also another thing that we we support our grant applications we can be a sponsoring organization for a coat you know one of the the oversight i don t know it s officially call it on on your grant so we have a mechanism for that and again so and i guess i want to put this in the context of my previous answer which is you know one of the things one of the reasons we don t just make the calendar open access or we don t make the listserv open access is so that when you havesomething that you want to get out to membership it helps us to have a little bit of a heads up about it so then we can help amplify in through appropriate channels and really try to organize our membership around that so there are lots of ways elocan support you even with your very very local events or even something that you might think is of a smaller order we can help bb co sponsors of those because we re trying to feel those is maybe a lot more decentralized then you might think okay thanks that s such an excellent point mark the other thing i ll say is i remember you know kind of as an emerging scholar encountering those those applications where it s like what is your dissemination strategy and what are your outreach and thinking like you know be an organization like this can be part of your dissemination strategy and you can say that you will amplify you know our network could be your network if you have a book that s coming out if you ve got a conference that s coming out if you have a grant that could use the new and you you re looking at the ways in which your results will be made you know will be will enter to community so this is something you might not have thought about before so thanks for reminding us mark people are winning things are wonderful to your scholarship agnieszka is that the correct way to pronounce your name can you correct me yes it was clearly pronounce thank you thank you well congratulations to your scholarship to the uk oh and you re working with kate ballinger that s fantastic and like she recently won a grant through the direct support of date dini and the yellow excellent will pay for students salaries yes keep those success stories coming jeremy height is writing one book that s one word today on twitter that s a lifetime project that s commitment jeremy thanks for that and we re talking about oh book launches like like she means new work fantastic yes i suppose supporting your book launches i guess that s the other way to imagine this is how we can serve you and what do you want out of your membershipmarket mark has raised his hand again or is that your can from before sorry you ve opened the floodgates yes in addition to hosting our monthly first friday yellows on the discord in of course supporting the second tuesday salons if you have a book that s coming out thats related to the electronic literature topics the first friday on the discord is a great place to have a lunch i m happy to host or we can get one of our other board members to host or where we can set up the perfect time for you and it really has turned out to be another fantastic platform to help promote the work of our members so sorry i just want to add that great margie i see your hand hello can you hear me yep we can hear you okay um you know i m just listening to all of this and thinking how incredible it is to see these wonderful people and all of this activity at this conference i m having having been around since with scott since we re in and and many others since we launched this elo way back in and we re now years into the project and it has exceeded anything i could have possibly imagined i want to welcome all the new people and all the people from around the world i want to congratulate the organizers of this when i tell people about the fact that we re in india denmark norway vancouver washington having a hour conference that includes people from all over the world the first thing that most people respond is so that must be a nightmare for the organizers and i i am just so impressed with the way that this this program has evolved and and i think that you also what you ve heard is that we re here for you we have grown in years to be able to serve our community in so many ways and we want you definitely to take advantage of that and to invite your friends to come to the next conference thanks for all of you for being here beautifully said my g that s another reason why ala was one of my favorite communities to margie and all of the amazing people who are here i also encourage you if you look around there are only participants in this chat this is a it s definitely a growing field you know very different from but at the same time this is still you know a global community in which you know we will get to know your names and everybody can make a difference you know we re we rebuilding this field together so thank you let s see no other hands right now but i m going to talk about rub link in the

welcome section as well so please go in and introduce yourself also continuing our work from last summer rob wedding and i are running the yellow cafe which is meant to be an informal space on the discord where you can gather and socialize with one another almost in the way we would if we were there in person maybe even better also just want to mention that there is a channel for the town hall so this conversation does not have to end here if you have other ideas or other thoughts or questions that come up during the course of the conference you can just go into that discordchannel and post them in there and they will be brought to the attention of the board something we could talk about during the retreat or people might even respond to you right there so please make make you know as whatever use you can and the discordis there to be not only a place where we can have these formal discussions but a place where we can maybe make up some of the parts of the informal conference that
