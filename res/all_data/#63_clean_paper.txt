 beyond maximalism resolving the novelistic incompatibilities of realism paranoia omniscience and encyclopedism through electronic literature abstract in the maximalist novel ercolino defines a type of novel that displays multiform maximizing and hypertrophic tension he lists pynchon s gravity s rainbow and mason dixon wallace s infinite jest delillo s underworld smith s white teeth franzen s the corrections and bolaño s as examples of the term and classifies the maximalist novel using ten elements length encyclopedic mode dissonant chorality diegetic exuberance completeness narratorial omniscience paranoid imagination intersemioticity ethical commitment and hybrid realism while ercolino s ten elements accurately identify and classify a significant novel form that has emerged i argue that these elements are incompatible with one another which has resulted in criticisms of maximalist novels as well as a number of maximalist novelists to abandon the form while ercolino argues that these incompatibilities represent an internal dialectic of the genre i argue that this is too conflicting to be stable as a novelistic form these incompatibilities include the incompatibility of multiple hybrid realisms the incompatibility of paranoid imagination with ethical commitment and the incompatibilities of narratorial omniscience and an encyclopedic mode with a persuasive realism by examining contemporary fictional works written by previously maximalist novelists i reassess ercolino s ten elements in order to identify the reasons why certain authors have moved beyond the limits of his definition in so doing i compare and contrast ercolino s maximalist novel with woods s hysterical realism and johnston s novel of information multiplicity using the franzen and smith corpuses as examples this paper speculates on the future form of the novel as it progresses into the st century from this literary interrogation i apply these conclusions to my digital creative practice by developing the digital novel the perfect democracy funded by the australia council for the arts this work takes as its subject the entire population of contemporary australia such a vast subject is impossible to represent in a work of fiction the whole work is presented as a d frame like artefact that can be navigated as a whole allowing readers to be presented with a multivalent broad canvas novel while resolving the paradoxical issues identified in my interrogation of ercolino i propose that this will be achieved by utilizing calvino s six memos images of australian currency will be used as a structural device to remove weight by representing the whole society from the richest to the poorest in the quickest way possible and a multitude of simultaneous digital writing formats and voices will be used to precisely depict characterization keywords maximalist novel realism relatedness paranoia narratorial omniscience introduction stefano ercolino defines the maximalist novel as an aesthetically hybrid genre of the contemporary novel that develops in the second half of the twentieth century maximalist for the multiform maximizing and hypertrophic tension of the narrative novel because the texts are indeed novels xi he lists thomas pynchon s gravity s rainbow and mason dixon david foster wallace s infinite jest don delillo s underworld zadie smith s white teeth jonathan franzen s the corrections and roberto bolaño s as examples of the term and classifies the maximalist novel using ten elements length encyclopedic mode dissonant chorality diegetic exuberance completeness narratorial omniscience paranoid imagination intersemioticity ethical commitment and hybrid realism while ercolino s ten elements accurately identify and classify a significant novel form that has emerged i argue that these elements are incompatible with one another which has resulted in criticisms of maximalist novels as well as a number of maximalist novelists to abandon the form while ercolino argues that these incompatibilities represent an internal dialectic of the genre i argue that this is too conflicting to be stable as a novelistic form these incompatibilities include the incompatibility of multiple hybrid realisms the incompatibility of paranoid imagination with ethical commitment and the incompatibilities of narratorial omniscience and an encyclopedic mode with a persuasive realism by examining contemporary fictional works written by previously maximalist novelists i reassess ercolino s ten elements in order to identify the reasons why certain authors have moved beyond the limits of his definition and how this may impact the novel form as it progresses into the st century in so doing i compare and contrast ercolino s maximalist novel with james woods s hysterical realism and john johnston s novel of information multiplicity finally i propose that these issues can be resolved through born digital works such as the australia council for the arts funded practice led research project the perfect democracy hybrid and hysterical realism ercolino claims that in maximalist novels the reader is faced with a unique form of realism one which is heavily conditioned by the powerful antireferential and tautological friction of the artistic act running throughout the entire system of the arts in the twentieth century he defines this as hybrid realism this is ercolino s final and most important element similar to ercolino s maximalist novel literary critic james wood in his review of zadie smith s white teeth human all too inhuman defines the hysterical realist genre which he also classifies with texts similar to those ercolino uses to define the maximalist novel wood is critical of these big ambitious social novels for their conceptual inhuman characters which he argues result from their insistence on relatedness he uses the term hysterical to denote the perpetual motion of the above mentioned novels plots the oxford companion to english literature states that as a literary term realism is so widely used it is more or less meaningless except when used in contradistinction to some other movement in how fiction works wood argues that literary realism is the origin from which all other literature emanates realism teaches everyone else it schools its own truants it is what allows magical realism hysterical realism to exist chekhov s challenge ibsen just doesn t know life in life it simply isn t like that is as radical now as it was a century ago because forms must continually be broken the true writer is one who must always be acting as if life were a category beyond anything the novel had yet grasped as if life itself were always on the verge of becoming conventional chekhov s revolution wood argues is that his characters have the ability to forget that they are characters by wriggling out of the story given them into the bottomless freedom of disappointment allowing their inner lives to run at their own speed it is this form of chekhovian realism that wood argues is not possible in maximalist hysterical realist novels examining chekhov s stories his style form and preoccupations are far removed from those values ercolino uses to define the maximalist novel not only is chekhov not a maximalist writer he is also not a novelist it would therefore come as no surprise that the chekhovian realism wood endorses is incompatible with the maximalist novel as it is essentially its antithesis yet both ercolino and wood use the same term realism esty argues that debates over literary realism what he calls realism wars have been ongoing since the late victorian era ercolino s description of hybrid realism suggests that the maximalist novels attempt to resolve the realism wars by representing multiple realisms within a single work in response to wood s criticism ercolino argues that realism and postmodern are not incompatible wood s position however is that such hybridity is not possible as the interrelatedness necessary for the hybridity to exist ultimately taints the chekhovian realist aesthetic even if isolated moments within the novel successfully depict it in information multiplicity similar to the maximalist hysterical realist genre johnston proposes the novel of information multiplicity arguing that this form emerges in an environment created by information and web technologies johnston and wood concur that in these works the antirealist impulse ultimately defines the novels realism in either case ercolino s element hybrid realism does not resolve the realism wars but is merely another example of it wood s position regarding the incompatibility of realism and the postmodern can be noted in his review of jonathan franzen s the corrections though the maximalist novel and hysterical realism had yet to be defined when franzen wrote the corrections franzen was aware of the predicament wood articulates i e that excessive relatedness can result in an unpersuasive realism i was torturing the story stretching it to accommodate ever more of those things in the world that impinge on the enterprise of fiction writing the work of transparency and beauty and obliqueness that i wanted to write was getting bloated with issues the novelist has more and more to say to readers who have less and less time to read where to find the energy to engage with a culture in crisis when the crisis consists in the impossibility of engaging with the culture in discussing his writing process he claims that the dehumanizing quality of contemporary character is a reflection of reality as in contemporary society our lives have become inhumanly interconnected franzen is therefore arguing against writing a novel of information multiplicity stressing a desire to move away from the antirealist impulse that johnston and wood argue characterizes the work of pynchon delillo etc as a novelist franzen wishes to inform and report to the reader on the state of the culture he concedes however that the novel no longer serves a function as social instruction even if the novel serves no role as reportage or social instruction franzen maintains that such a novel should strive to be all encompassing in other words franzen champions maximalism as an ideal in and of itself franzen s solution then is to create a broad canvas novel that attempts to make interconnectedness human what wood calls a softened delilloism in the corrections franzen retains the core ambitions of the maximalist novel while moving beyond ercolino s definition wood praises this softened delillo approach but believes the artistic success of franzen s novel is not because of its extreme interconnectedness but in spite of it even if the ambitions of the maximalist hysterical realist novelist can coexist with chekhovian realism wood argues that they are not comparable the connection between a malaise in ourselves and in our culture is purely conceptual and muddies the chekhovian realism that centers the novel this suggests that it has become impossible for the contemporary novel form to pin down an entire writhing culture paranoid imagination ethical commitment and the influence of kafka ercolino argues that paranoia is one of the most characteristic elements of the postmodern narrative universe he continues everything is linked this is the unshakeable conviction of the paranoid a conviction that finds its structural equivalent in the direct or indirect interconnection of all the stories of all the characters and of all the events that proliferate in maximalist novels paranoia then can be regarded as one of the antirealist impulses ercolino notes in describing hybrid realism likewise johnston argues that pynchon and delillo s works are characterized by paranoia in gravity s rainbow he writes that paranoia is no longer designated a mental disorder but rather a critical method of information retrieval the paranoid imagination ercolino defines can be observed not only in the novels described but also in franz kafka s amerika pynchon in bloom delillo in depietro wallace rushdie smith in changing my mind and bolaño in klenemeier have all cited the importance of kafka in relation to their work for the contemporary maximalist novelist kafka s influence appears fittingly inescapable amerika evokes the dreamlike claustrophobia and agoraphobia typical of kafka s novels which is due to the novel s paranoid imagination the narrative relies on coincidence and excessive relatedness the difference between kafka s novel and the novels described however is its relation to real phenomena while informed by research of the present hofmann in kafka amerika claims kafka s book is up to the minute with its telephones and gramophones electric bells and electric torches lifts the brooklyn bridge and an early reference to coca cola xiii from the opening paragraph in which the statue of liberty is seen holding a sword it becomes clear that kafka s amerika bears little resemblance to a real experience of a european immigrant in the united states the interconnectedness is persuasive as kafka establishes a dream like quality and logic unlike the hysterical realists whose close examination of real world issues creates immediate enclosed context kafka s novels elude such readings given contemporary widespread information and global awareness however writing of other countries institutions or cultural groups with such disconnect from real phenomena presents ethical representational issues in her review of the maximalist novel hayles notes that ercolino does not make reference to the influence of information technologies databases computational media much of the impetus toward the massive information flows apparent in the examples derive from the creation and dissemination of the personal computer the emergence of the web the spread of social media and the pervasiveness of internet search engines hayles continues that these developments undoubtedly explain why the maximalist novel differs from other big encyclopedic modernist novels e g melville s moby dick and joyce s ulysses similarly these developments i e emergence of the web spread of social media etc highlight a significant difference between the paranoid imagination displayed in the works of kafka and in the contemporary maximalist novelists in other words one cannot write or indeed read as kafka did in the contemporary digital age in the information networked age a novel that is structured by paranoia yet aspires towards ethical commitment as ercolino claims the maximalist novel does is ultimately at odds with itself in bolaño s for example the heavy interrelatedness of the novel s structure draws a comparison between the female homicides of ciudad juárez and world war ii and the holocaust it is difficult however to determine in what capacity one atrocity can or should illuminate another and how a reader should make this comparison indeed s structure explicitly segregates these components ercolino posits that his elements can be split into two camps playing different roles in the internal dialectic of the genre and that a hierarchy of the materials is always presupposed which guarantees the genre s morphological and symbolic hold this he labels the chaos cosmos function anarchy versus order centrifugal forces versus centripetal forces chaos versus cosmos in then the relationship between female homicides of ciudad juárez and the holocaust could either be meaningful cosmos or simply two independent events that have no correlation chaos the novel s paranoid imagination that informs the novel s interrelated structure however both allows and encourages parallels between the female homicides and the holocaust not only the structure but the meaning of the work is defined by its paranoia the very notion of a cosmos function is at odds with maximalist novels social realism in the case of the social realism of the very relentless specific almost journalistic approach to the female homicides is at odds with a parallel to the holocaust despite the fact that maximalist novels are monopolized by themes of great historical political and social relevance addressing themes such as history war drugs capitalism and technology ercolino the use of paranoid imagination to draw connections between these themes lacks ethical commitment as it draws immoral parallels narratorial omniscience and cliché since wood s review of zadie smith s white teeth in which he defines and criticizes hysterical realism smith has written of her shifting approach towards the contemporary novel smith argues that such hysteria is necessary as in contemporary culture the immediacy of news political commentary and satire means that the fiction writer who addresses contemporary issues or institutions risks cliché even if you find pynchon delillo foster wallace etc obtuse they can rarely be accused of cliché and that is the place where everything dies smith further explores her desire to make connections in her essay rereading barthes and nabokov she finds barthes s notion of reader authority appealing as a reader but paralyzing when applied to the act of writing itself white teeth for example is constructed in such a way as to represent a vast multiplicity of voices within the culture the text stretches itself to accommodate and engage with a profusion of public and private issues to avoid plot immobility coincidence dickensian caricature and paranoid imagination are utilized which has resulted in wood s criticisms in her essay smith contrasts barthes s approach with nabokov s assertion of authorial privilege barthes spoke of the pleasure of the text nabokov of asking his students to read with your brain and spine the tingle in the spine really tells you what the author felt and wishes you to feel barthes though had no interest in what the author felt or wished you to feel which is where my trouble starts this trouble is the desire to create an authorial text that accounts for the birth of the reader s without resorting to excessive interrelatedness or the potential cliché of twenty first century bourgeois political apathy smith attempts to resolve this trouble in her fourth novel nw stylistically it marks a departure from her other work utilizing a combination of first and third person perspective numbered fragments and typographical arrangements nw does not display paranoid imagination as connected events become tangential having quiddity in and of themselves particularity is based primarily on class rather than ethnicity similar to irie jones at the conclusion of white teeth at the conclusion of nw natalie blake feeling decentered and fraudulent sets up anonymous sex encounters via the internet unlike irie in white teeth however the decentered form that reflects keisha natalie s decentered sense of identity makes this choice human and persuasive rather than conceptual or hysterical at the novel s conclusion after natalie s affairs have been exposed and she loses track of her children in a pet store smith writes she raised her head from her newspaper she called out nothing she walked to the fish the lizards the dogs and the cats nowhere she reassured herself she wasn t the hysterical emphasis mine type a significant difference between white teeth and nw is the novel s use of omniscient narration paul dawson argues that twenty first century fiction has seen a revival of omniscient narration and that this emerges from an encounter with some of the technical experiments of postmodern fiction in the case of white teeth dawson argues that there are substantial passages of digressive and garrulous commentary throughout the novel which directly address the reader the narrator employs the editorial we to rhetorically invoke a general consciousness in nw however such an authorial voice is absent though the novel fluctuates between four different characters perspectives the points of view themselves remain that of the characters nw therefore has more in common with the modernist novels than the omniscient perspective of white teeth nw would not be classified as a maximalist novel as a result any intersemioticity or diegetic exuberance is justified as being the voice of the character smith s reduced omniscience and interconnectedness in nw suggests a stylistic return to the modernist novel in order to both account for the birth of the reader s without resorting to excess or cliché while a text such as nw rejects johnston s assertion that the literary form must be machinic it contains characters who are capable of interacting with such information systems it therefore remains both contemporary i e of the networked digital age and human a light encyclopedic mode ercolino argues that a key element in defining the maximalist novel is an encyclopedic mode encyclopedism is not the ambition of the maximalist novelist rather it is a tool in attempting to satisfy its synthetic ambition ercolino cites italo calvino crediting him with pointing out that the desire to write encyclopedic works was one of the strongest aspirations of modernism in six memos for the next millennium calvino addresses the encyclopedic under his lecture on multiplicity calvino s own later novels reflect this value what is not present in the later novels of calvino however is a sense of chekhovian lyrical realism even in a novel such as if on a winter s night a traveler where particular chapters display a sense of realism it is framed and presented as a construct as well as a less forced interconnectedness smith expresses a predilection for controlled little gasps of prose as opposed to the baggy novel and an admiration for these qualities in the works of kafka borges and cortázar smith goes on to ask if it is this reverence this care this suppression of ego that wood wants to see from us this reverence is shown in nw but is taken a step further in smith s the embassy of cambodia smith still interweaves particularities but reduces this density so as to lighten the amount of reality imposed on her characters and the text in other words the embassy of cambodia depicts chekhovian realism this opposes ercolino s first element length smith s rejection of length however does not necessarily reject the core ambitions of the maximalist novel as it does not necessitate a reversion to literary minimalism smith still interweaves particularities but reduces this density so as to lighten the amount of reality imposed on her characters and the text plots do not converge at a central apex rather the plot leaves the protagonist unemployed with a wholly unclear future smith s predilection could therefore be regarded as a desire for what calvino labels lightness for calvino lightness is understood in terms of its binary opposite weight his reason for treasuring lightness is a desire to write in such a way as to represent his own time to identify himself with the collective and individual energies propelling the events of the century the weight of all these issues however becomes problematic when attempting to write cohesive dramatic engaging fiction as ercolino points out the problem with the encyclopedic project in the postmodern is that it explodes crushed by its own weight borrowing from greek mythology calvino compares this type of weighty text to the stare of the medusa in that it paralyses language and narrative this however is not to suggest that a writer should ignore the weight of the world though binary opposites enable calvino to define his values this does not necessitate the negation of the binary opposite like perseus who decapitated the medusa and carried its head the writer should be light without negating or neglecting weight miller in dawson argues that the rise of the maximalist hysterical realist movement was in fact a shift in american fiction away from minimalism exemplified in the tradition from hemingway to carver to maximalism smith s the embassy of cambodia therefore is not simply a return to literary minimalism but a move beyond maximalism in that it retains the ambition of the maximalist novel while shedding length weight smith s nw and the embassy of cambodia suggest that while depicting interconnectivity is possible and even potentially persuasive it is not a vital revelation in the case of nw while the stories are interconnected this is primarily to justify its structure as a novel in fact the embassy of cambodia with its willesden setting reads almost as an nw offcut this brings into question the necessity for the lyrical realist novel as an appropriate form to depict contemporary culture and whether or not it will persist for reasons other than tradition or money the perfect democracy this practice led research takes as its subject the entire population of contemporary australia it is also about the impossibility of representing this in a work of fiction visible images of australian currency have therefore been used as a requisite structural device to remove weight by representing the whole society from the richest to the poorest in the quickest way possible a multitude of simultaneous writing formats palimpsestic writing columns d shapes etc and voices wills business plans legal transcripts stream of consciousness etc are used to precisely depict characterisation the whole work forms a border like shape that interconnects everything literally persuasively and diegetically in the contemporary hyper interconnected pandemic context it would appear that we need the maximalist novel more than ever at the same time the incompatibilities articulated above are all the more prominent through this practice led research project i hope to show how the incompatibilities of the contemporary novel can be resolved in new electronic literary forms that push beyond
