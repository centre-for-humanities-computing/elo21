i m based in central europe so back yeah precisely so like literally across the board okay and it s pm so without further ado i would start this session and the audience is already coming good afternoon everyone i hesitated for a brief moment because we re justthat we are spanned across time zones so actually for me it is good afternoon and it s really about you and since ben is ben crosser is located in she got close to chicago eating only lauren and rachel are close to orlando florida and justin is also philadelphia although on usually close to london los angeles so um so we have several time zones we have three brilliant papers i picked a bit in your papers and i m really looking forward to hearing more about ben s artwork the endless those colors that also is on the display in our exhibition copy and literature and then we ll progress and and we ll be listening to lauren and rachel talking about interesting use of tinder app and i guess and finally justin about alternate reality games around i was interested in some time ago so i m really looking forward to all three presentationsbecause there is some kind of but i m wondering what kind of a common theme will be running through all the presentations it remains to be seen and i think we can discuss about that later so ben the floor is yours the virtual for all the floor is yours thanks sarahcascade to find the right window there we go stay to find the right window there we go okay nice to see you all see if i can actually see you all while i do this here all right you all can see the presentation yes yes we can see thanks so nice to be here and happy to be talking with you all so for many years now the smartphone has provided comfort and distraction during breaks in the regular flow of time but perhaps no moment in modern history has provided such widespread breaks in the normal flows the early pandemic of and eagerly awaiting anyone who reached for their phones over the last months for the social media platform so place many gettheir news from but these sites aren t designed to inform they re designed to engage us and they want to show whatever they can to keep us on the site and perhaps nothing more engaged us in then bad news and so the combination of these factors produced a proliferation of excessive bad news reading during the pandemic a condition so common that it gained a new term doom scrolling down scrolling refers to the ways in which people find themselvesregularly and in some cases almost in voluntarily scrolling bad news headlines on their phone often four hours each night in bed when they had meant to be sleeping and while we all need to stay on top of the news and case pandemic recommendations change do scrolling wasn t just a natural reaction to the news the day it was an activity largely produced by social media interfaces designed to show us whatever they could in order to keep us engaged and a primary mechanism central to do the scrolling is the infinite scroll a dynamic interface design that makes surethe page a user is reading never ends and its aim is to reduce friction as well as to obscure surveillance infrastructure behind the scenes and anytime we find a platform working to reduce friction should generally be taken as a clue to look more closely to think about why it s reducing friction interested in poland theorize about the object produced through such techniques as a meta interface layer between user and system that employs techniques like minimalist hiding to blur the monitoring monitoring and profiling such interfaces enable hidingthe fact that while we read them they read us back and their aim is to predict what will keep us they re transforming in this case human reading away from an active consumption into a sort of looping consumption of negative headlines the cultural effects of interfaces is an ongoing subject and that are an electronic literature and i mentioned a number of works in my full paper context so i want to talk for a moment about an artwork of mine that fits within this frame and which investigates the cultural effects of doom scrolling and so work called the endless doom scroller it s an alternative interface that acts as a lens on our pandemic era software enabled collective descent into despair released in summer of it presents itself as a simplified social media feed and each and clickable button contains a short headline such as all events canceled devastation worsens lockdowns imminent outbreak continues the numbers look bad thingslike that and the only thing you can do with those headlines is scroll and no matter how long one scrolls or how fast the endless demons scroll or will never stop presenting its bad news headlines they just keep coming and the works primary technique can be argued as one of reduction the work distills news and social media sites down to their barest most generalized messages and interface conventions headlines are simplified versions of real ones and the interface that presents them is reduced to its core interaction the infinitescroll and so through these tactics the endless doom scroller deconstructs the doom scrolling meta interface revealing how it s changing what and how we read in the digital and pandemic age feedback shows that for some it can create an opportunity for mindfulness about how they spend their time online for others the peace enables of sort of exposure or substitution therapy a way to escape or replace what doom scrolling interfaces want from and do to us and through its reduction the word cantor s the many interfaces minimalist hiding with a sort of minimalist revealing or reduction that shows rather than hides and ultimately what the endless doom scroller does is to show us how the software structures of social media change not only what we read but how we read as a static reductive interface experience it provides renewed opportunities for agency within the systems we all find ourselves stuck in in other words when it comes to reading social media and the agent pandemic whoops perhaps the only way out of too much doing scrolling is endless scrolling thanks i over the lasthave enough time later i m sure there will be some questions are comingin now i m i m passing the torch so to speak lauren or else do i pronounce your surname okay yeah so laura morales and rachel winter and we re delving into tinder hold on just a second i have like okay great and right hi everyone my name is lauren rouse and i am here with my co author rachel winter and we are presenting our paper called swype nights was fun but useless and analysis of there s a swipe night and interactive foray into online dating so swipe nights was debuted and october and allowed tinder users to navigate through a narrative based around the premise that they had three hours until the end of the world each sunday a new episode premiered and users had until midnight toplay through the story so we re going to watch the little trailer that they have with this oh sorry all right we re good i could not hear any sound lauren yeah we don t yeah sorry thanks rachel still don t hear the sound i feel like the visuals are probably fine okay just okay when you when you tried before the session status so yeah that s surprising okay i was unsure if that would work but it s just a little second trailer talking about the kind of narratives that played through this entire adventure so users choices helped shaped not only the unfolding of the narrative but also contributed to potential matches with other tinder users i divergence from tenders usual practice of matching users by proximity at the end of the gameplay users could post their results to their prototype profile for potential match users to see so because tinder facilitates one to one communication through private messages we had to find a different approach to study user reactions his wife night event because we didn t have access to those messages obviously so the reddit platform and specifically the subreddit are tinder provides a space for tinder users to post screenshots messages and bios as well to reflect on their tinder experiences as a community so to collect data from that subreddit we use the free web web scraper parse hub to collect data from the top most relevant threads from our gender so again it wasn t specifically dedicated this white knight so we looked for threads within the subreddit that were dedicated to the interactive fiction and so when users would post about swype nights on their tinder profile these two graphics on the left side of your screen are what it would show up looking like on their profile and where the choices were so and the top left we have a bio which wouldjust be if you open the tinder app and so it says that they had the ending of molly s house which is from the first episode and then the second image on the screen is a more in depth within a bio and the bio actually says anyone else keep getting stressedout by the swipe night game i keep selecting the wrong things and they have a episode two with their ending and the choices that they made as well so after we collected our data from the our tinder subreddit we used orange data visualization to run a sentiment analysis sentiment analysis uses natural language processing to determine whether text has a positive neutral or negative connotation following sentiment analysis we created a heat map which is this image on your screen which orders the data into blue negative emotions or yellow positive emotions there are also neutral responses which express neither positive nor negative responses sentiment analysis gets a lot of like flat kind of from academia about how you can t really tell if something is positive or negative and so that s why we wanted to compile also the neutral sentiments as well so we actually found that there was a large amount of neutral statements including those in which users were discussing their technical issues with the application and then crowdsourcing potential troubleshooting solutions so this provides us some insight into the role that platform coordinators and community have in the way that users interact so tinder only enables private communication so it s a form that says don t enable crowdsourcing solutions which sends users insearch of platforms with designs that better enable this type of communication such as reddit with it s dedicated subreddit we also found that the compound score had an overall negative sentiment some users argued that swipe night was annoying or useless while others expressed frustration with the scenarios in the game to which they cannot relate such as the choice whichrequired users to either cover for or expose a fred graham s infidelity which is the context for the quote on the right hand side of the slide the girls will hate my choice because i covered program but in all reality i would have never gotten involvedin the first place so this indicates that although interactivity that s commonly been associated with increased identification with characters reactions to swipe night suggest that moral and ethical predicaments can result in an opposite reaction especially when user choices may result in an impact offline such as their potential matters on matches on the tinder platform and also potential future offline meetups so this suggests that the context of the tinder platform impacts user engagementwith and response to the interactive fiction so it not only highlighted the gamification and hyper textual methods at play in modern day dating but also brought to the forefront issues of morality and ethics in finding a potential partner so the context of swipe night on the to their platform suggests that platform the coordinators and community impact audience reception of and engagement with fiction then from a story disengage from users online identities thank you and we have our contact info here and i encourage you to read our full paper to thank you so much i guess respectable what blasphemous changes from one presentation to another and next week that might be the running theme or how we see the platforms through all the examples discuss here even if our next even though our next presentation is actually cross platform as alternate reality games usually are justin oh yeah thank you let me share screen okay hi everybody my name is justin board mac and my paper is called dangerous games our social media platforms are participatory propaganda we figured that out for the title on the slide but i figured i would just make sure so before i give a brief overview of the specifics of the five minutes or so that were allotted i wanted to first throw out some definitions the first one is for alternate reality games for those who aren t familiar for our purposes today i ll quoteyou a definition from the source of all human knowledge wikipedia which is that an alternate reality game or arg is an interactive networks narrative that uses the real world as a platform and employs transmedia storytelling to deliver a story that maybe altered by players ideas or actions so i m going to use art for the rest of the session i professionally designed several arts for there s the definition there for video games and marketing campaigns for films and private entertainment well well well executed they re really fun they re sort of like a massive live action role play with thousands of participants all working together to unravel the mystery or achieve a goal so i m guessing everyone doesn t social media is i won t take the time to break that one down that ll bring me to the third gigabyte title which is participatory propaganda this is a term coined by alicia wallace and michael burke and represents a paradigm shift and propaganda distribution traditional propaganda comes from the top down is the old ways it s usually run by the state or some other powerful body with the ability to widely produce and distribute messaging they do things like print newspapers and run radio and television programmingrewrite history books changing curriculum to get it to the masses under the new paradigm the propaganda is delivered from the ground up so the original messaging is still produced by somebody with power the agenda but then it spread to a small group of hardcore true believers who then spread it through their own social channels both in person on mine then you can see the potential for exponential growth here if there are believers that you share it with friends or family and of those say three buy in and each spencer more friends and family all soon you ve built your grassroots in other words a top down effort transforms into a body bottom up seemingly organic movement so i have maybe two minutes left out of five so that time i d like to briefly highlight a real world example which you re all probably familiar with to some degree q and on cuba is the current conspiracy theory does your the united states and thoughit s by no beats the first example of that sort of thing that i wrote about because we sought after as well for example briefly for the blessedly out of this year but i m sorry to do this to uq is a conspiracy theory that posits that the entireunited states is controlled by a shadowy cabal of pedophiles and that the members of this group of the leaders of the democratic party celebrities and billionaires against these forces donald trump is waging a war of justice adversity with the goalsgoals exposing their crimes and restoring american to its former greatness there are a lot of reasons that people buy into this story and we don t have time to go through them in this talk but many revolve around things like perceived as power budgetmarginalization alienation and of course if you believe this is true you have a moral imperative to support the former president as loudly as possible and tell everybody you know about what s going on because children are at stake human on is a sort of alternate reality game but it s just that nobody has told the players that it is real id act exactly the same way as a game master the mysterious q he s ostensibly a government official with first hand knowledge of trump s value of struggle q posts cryptic messages to social media which q adherence rapid rapidly devour and parse for meaning just like players have an arc spent hours for your professionalwebsites and reading fabricated documents as they attempt to solve puzzles which are created by game designers q followers do the same thing with real life the smallest things become imbued with utmost importance so for example at trump s with farewell speech on january there were american flags on stage he was the th letter of the alphabet so this was clearly a coded signed to keep the faith despite joe biden s and petting a dog duration of this isthis is all quite horrifying to people like me who decided to sort of entertainment as we re seeing our work co opted for decidedly the various purposes unfortunately many game designers aren t even aware that there are tools are being appropriated level of what those tools are being made to do there are a few ways to go about trying to address this problem but i d be happy to talk about them in the q amp a discussion if folks are interested but the big picture is that we have a real problem here and currently the commercial games industryis perfectly happy to keep pressing forward and happy ignorance churning out ever more entertainment that bolsters rather than and provides those who have real interested in supporting darcy i m sorry to end on that downer note and it s not all bad i promise but we re we re about at the end of the five minutes that they told us to use so i wanted to turn it over to the back back to the moderator for the q amp a here from the other panelistsas well and i m sure we could live discussion back around to some of these things if the opportunity arises like you very much thank you very much thank you very much i i on the other hand encourage the audience to have a big at the papers which are stored in a conference system it s definitely interesting right and and now the q amp a session we have plenty of time and i hope we have lots of interesting questions on the one is already here actually the two of them are already here in the chat one comes from alan s on home and then the one from germany hideand i don t know alan would you like to pose the question now yourself can you hear me yeah yeah i was reading gordon all ports book on studies and prejudice and one of the things that he talks about is an experiment that was done this is all really i think back in the s where a group of individuals who are class somewhere classified as prejudice some areclassified as non prejudice and relationship to say black issues and so forth and they were showed both groups everybody was shown a truncated a diagram of a truncated pyramid pyramid which was tilted to one side and the people and then they were asked several months later to redraw to draw what they remember to the pyramid and the people who were prejudiced by and large drew the pyramid symmetrically which it wasn t in the original drawing it people who didn t score high on a prejudice scale do it as closer to the original which was lopsided so there s a they were making a point there s a tendency to simplify and to find these causal change the symmetries which are related to causal change rather than deal with the complexity of say the contemporary world which q amp on cuts through brilliantlyactually because if you can trace everything to something that s on the level of mythos becomes much easier to believe because then everything becomes a sign or signifier towards that so i think this plays very much into what we re into what we re talking about hereis a question for someone particular all to all panelists so all panelists but particularly to the last thanks justin yeah justin so maybe i m not sure i understood understood the question could you could yourepeat the core of it just like you said a lot of stuff so i want to make sure i don t misunderstand it was more it was more a comment on where prejudice arrives arises were queuing on arises needs situation and basically it s the idea that you collapse the complexity of contemporary life into into simply a core which is a core based on classical cause and effect so yes a comment about this yeah i think you re right here to live particularly if you re not particularly educated or if you re not used to really questioning critiqueor developing critique of your own yeah i think you re right aboutwhen you said it s about collapsing complexity that s that s one of those reasons that i mentioned people get addicted is because they feel like the world doesn t make sense and here is an explanation that says oh you know here s a very straightforward reason why all of the things that seemed to make sense in your life before don t anymore it sand so it simplifies like you said a world that appears to be nonsensical into a framework that they can easily follow but it s interesting that it also at least according to that one experiment and i ve seen other things similar it also really affects your ability later on to process information with it pyramids people actually remembered things differently as a result of something as a result of a kind of compression of belief yeah thank you justin would you like to answer to our other panelists yeah the others other panelists will do like to come out on what just what was just said yeah so i think yeah thank you thank you actually it is a very complex issue so i don t think this panel alone would you know ever ever fulfill the whole space that s needed to discuss the subject so i like to i d like to turn to jeremy jeremy would like to ask your question yourself i ve been a fan of ben s project for a while and it was really really fascinating to see two other projects that to me i m seeing all these connective threads and one of them is that i teach it to colleges and one of them is done but the other i teach ethics and rhetoric and two of the options that we ve been covering throughout the semester are that the kind of the the training that the sort of fractureline between techno utopianism and dystopia and the immersive kind of narcotizing nature of so much information and so you have tinder which you can passively scroll through or you can engage relationships you have conspiracy theories which have beenrising and some of the some of the things we looked at or some people argue it s the dystopic times or any other say perhaps it s people looking at in terms of psychology that when the world is so uncertain conspiracy theories are like a warm cup ofcocoa because you can find an answer to something you can understand like the early naming of god s in history right and then bends project is how and i ve known him through social media so this is perfect to start with that is that you can passively scroll through your social media but it s been so dark for at least two years now that it becomes a dooms girl so he s touching on something butthe thread that i that i was curious among all the panelists is that what do you think about what what someone like me sitting here at am or whatever here in la that i m seeing between all of what you re dealing with is that so there s a narrative within tender tender and its promotional but it s fascinating that you re looking at data that was kind of like the null set data like the mundane any data not just the expected engagement that the commercial aspect would go for and how that relates to the larger platform and then ben s projectand then justin s like how much is it that you re all incisively going deeper into things that we can passively just be immersed in on our phones thank you sir ben would you like to comment yeah i think i think i appreciate your efforts to draw connections across these different papers i guess you know playing off of a little bit it is the idea and then the theme of the conference just platform platform in the pandemic i suppose andwhile you know in my case social media in general maybe is the platform i m thinking about and for rachel and lauren it s it s tinder for justin i suppose it s it s more broad than that but of course maybe a chance the case that q amp is the platformbut it s not quite the same thing but definitely behind the scenes of all platforms is the design of the algorithm that presents information with an intention and that intention is not always in the foreground i would say and i see that as maybe aconnective tissue across the papers in response to to jeremy that in the case of social media it s feed algorithms designed to engage in the case of tinder you know obviously there s the intention to connect and enable connection but of course there salso the gathering of data and everything else that happens in every kind of platform algorithmic platform in the case of qn on perhaps q amp on i suppose might be considered the the algorithm behind the scenes that instigates and triggers differentkinds of reactions but of course there s the environment maybe it s the environment of kind ofconspiracy theory thinking that becomes the algorithm in that case anyway that s that s just one way i kind of response i can see some connections thank you ben and lauren and rachel i have also some separate questions for you about tinder in a moment but would you like to comment on on this question yeah i think that a lot of the time that sort of activity that we see as being sort of passive scrolling is actually a lot more meaningful than we perceive in addition to the algorithms like ben was mentioning the design of platforms i mean platformsare designed by human beings and then they re instantiated with the values of those human beings and they shape the way that people engage with both the technological important says and the community on those platforms and i think that understandinghow actually very intentional a lot of our seemingly meaningless activity is can give you a really significant look into not only platform design but also how people approach those designs so whether or not people choose to use the important isn t itwill end the way that they re intended or choose to resist that intention their choices are still being shaped by the importance of these platforms and i think that understanding that and understanding how people engage differently with different platformsand different populations and give us a pretty significant insight not only into the human activity factor of it but also how the design can impact those choices you you just yeah so no i think rachel said everything but i wouldn t have said sort of waiting for for you also commenting on but anyway like i said there is no question and directed to you specifically we have a monitoring chance by the way but if you want to ask your question or cervical also raise hands and i be dividing my my attention between two channels we have two questions from daniel cox actually one question is for justin and another one is for lauren and rachel and then soren bold so daniel please would you like to ask your question yourself or just direct people to chat yes i could attempt to answer it or ask it sorry i m just i feel like this was actually answered before but i m interested within the art design spaces could you talk a little bit more about the complications when our design spaces come into contact with conspiracy theories i feel like you started to address that and i m interested in if there are any interesting stories or comments you could just share on that topic so you mean when our spaces come into contact with like real conspiracy theories that are out there in the world independent of the game correct yeah well i think it s very common for that to happen because i d say that one of the ready made forms for an alternate reality games if you re a designer and you just want to make one is a conspiracy theory narrative because it just presented it you can make up anything you can just say oh yeah it s part of the conspiracy and people buy into it right affectionately i haven t seen a lot of contact with people who are currently playing an alternate reality game butting up against a real conspiracy theory that is not part of the game and having that end up becoming incorporated that s one of the strengths of the farm is that they cast a very wide net and then examine everything so they might say hey there s this thing going on is this part of the game put it on the list of things that like to monitor but we can t get anything out of it if this is especially in every really successful game with thousands of players like a ruthlessly efficient to plot efficient process of vetting content so i m not sure that i ve seen existing conspiracies get co opted into a game but i have seen conspiracy theories that people actually believe in in the real world like the illuminati or the committee of or the protocols of the elders of zion that sort of stuff used as the basis to make a fictional game if that makes sense thank you i agree it is very interesting topic so to speak like you know the alternate reality game i mean customer conspiracy theories might have prepared the ground for you know some kind of fantasy and reality blake daniel your second questionis for lauren and right all right yes lord and rachel i m interested in so rachel was speaking to the importance of different platforms i m interested in how important secondary platforms you mentioned read it in connection to tinder how much did these create an opportunity or create a space for communities from other platforms so if you re for example you mentioned collecting things from reddit and i m kind of interested in the afforded says of different platforms and the waysin which if you want to sort of speak to the content from your paper connecting allowing twitter users to congregate on another platform to talk about a different platform this is interesting sort of inter platform connection here yeah definitely so um we initially did this research and i think the beginning of and because it was just about like three months after the original swype night had aired and so we really wanted to see kind of what people were talking abouton other platforms and when we had gone on to twitter we couldn t really find anything super specific so we decided to head over to read it where there is a pretty big tinder community and people use that platform to like share funny files or profilesthat they find they do like a match of the week thing where people will share like their beginning messages with the match and they like all vote on it and they talking about like they re bad experiences are just people being like rude on tinder but it definitely had like kind of the tech supportaspect of it that we hadn t expected when originally setting out for swipe night specifically um so there are definitely like a lot of audiences for looking at these like trans platform type uses for something like swype night because it shows thattinder which is specifically often like very personal and you usually don t get to share that kind of aspect with your matches on tinder it shows that that still build like a community of users outside of maybe like your close friends or anything likethat so looking trans platform why is we were able to see that there were definitely places that people like congregate and talk about tinder that are not just on the tinder app as well rachel do you have anything to add thank you thank you much more questions coming to you and but now i m passing the torch to soren who had who has another two questions one for jesse and one for ben yeah maybe it s a question for both of you i was i was of course struck by what been talked about when he sort of talked about this minimalist hiding that you try to counteract with a minimalist revealing and and you ended with this that the end of today s coding is the is endless doom scrollingand and and then we have this example of the sixth of january interaction with qn on and i just you know i m i m not american tired you know i didn t follow it that kills you but but of course we all heard about it and and one of the things that struck me was the way many of these people that were caught in congress were surprised somehow that it wasn t a game or that it was something that was really happening and not you know just something on social media but something that had real consequences and was actually you know illegal and stuff so so in that sense it seemed to become some kind of example of and it s ization of politics that happens through these are great new platformsthat they were they are were caught in but we all caught in them somehow and and and and so i m wondering and you know it s a it s a reflection of gone with for a while and also talked to ben with it earlier but but but how can we ever start tounderstand read this this way of you know reading how they read us in some sense of course it s been a while but in other ways it s also highly complex and maybe as complex as the many ways these platforms try to hide it so it s yeah it s both a politicalquestion but it s also very sort of an infrastructural interface interface question right and maybe maybe the political question is for justin and the more interface related could be for beenyeah thanks lauren certainly i guess i think about the political part of it too but the the certainly in the way i ended up writing about the work and the steam scroller was inspired by your work and christians work to just try to think about we all in turn i mean i think when we we live in algorithmic platforms that are you know whether it s all the social media platforms are making decisions about what we see and what we don t all the time i think a condition that s common across most if not all users of algorithmic platforms is some kind of internalization to internalized idea of what the algorithm is or what it s doing or how it thinks or usually manifest in the kinds of signals thatpeople send back to the system imagining that it s going to have some positive effect they might like certain kinds of things thinking that will produce more of those things and they might move quickly past other things and hopes that the system doesn tlock on to that and show them more of the thing they don t want but often when you talk to him at least i think about my own teaching with students at the university you know we talk about social media and there s a there s often a kind of dismissiveattitude towards the lack of worry a lack of concern that kind of is present about all this decision making and what its effects might be and and i think you know the with thinking about the meta interface and minimalist hiding this kind of you know super slick make it all really clean and nice and then like all of the massive distributed server based surveillance systems that are goingon underneath capturing every possible move i talked about this in detail in the paper but you know recording every scroll every moment you hold your mouse over something but don t click everything you type but then delete you know just like you know every little bit is captured and recorded and analyzed in order to best engage the user to keep them on the platform and so part of what i found and reactions to the students girl or which is really not a social media platform it s kind of just takingtaking the interface conventions and the message conventions of of headlines and putting into a very simplified form is that it often would produce this reaction of oh this is what i ve been doing with my time i ve just been stuck in this system and when you when you boil it down it s easier to see it s easier to feel that that s what we ve been feeling i think that s kind of what i end up hearing from people and so that s where i kind of decided to think about it as this minimalist revealing and as a kind of a counter to the minimalist hiding thatminimal was hiding i you know i would think of is as a strategy to push you know completely off the screen the things that they don t want you to know and with minimal revealing i guess i ve been thinking about it is pushing only the things onto the screen that i want people to think about as in the ways that they engage with the interface so you know you know getting rid of the thing that that maybe drew them there in the first place but leaving the things that the systemthem as the primary performances which in this case are bad news headlines and scroll forever thank you so much justin yeah i think this answer might address some of the questions that have popped up in chat since then i see there s a q amp a discussion going on there and i think the first part is to adjust you know you say you re not america you did you know you re aware of it but you weren t paying close attention and i think for people who live in america most of them are not aware of this but conspiracy theory q and on is not it s the latest incarnation in a long line like i said you know we saw the same sort of thing after september but even going further back to that to like the election ofandrew jackson we saw conspiracy theories as the primary or amongst the primary political toolboxes for getting elected to the presidency even though it s probably no coincidence that donald trump says jackson was his favorite presidentand the reemergence of conspiracy theories into the political sphere in the st century is actually i think part of a larger like reversion to the mean for american culture the polarization the misinformation the fake news the conspiracy theories all of that used to be very tightly wound into the american political culture and it s sort of vanished after the post war period for reasons that i could speculate about i m not an expert i think it has to do with shared experiences kabocha the racialgender sexuality amongst those who were in power allowing them to sort of have a common ground which is harder today with increased representation and rights which i think is a good thing but it s introduced new challenges so i think that the platform concerned in conspiracy theory when it comes to q and on is that it lets it spread much more efficiently right you know if you let s say indicted if you believe that i don t know aliens were going to arrive and teach universal brotherhood which was a you know we all think that you know that if you look at elliot narratives from the s that s what was that was a universal brotherhood and harmony and understandingall age of aquarius stuff even if some people believed you you have to like go out and personally tell people about this at the vast majority of people are going to say to you hey you re crazy and like the group pressure around that is going to make it so you re not going toget very far but these platforms allow us to find very specialized niche audiences to reach that you would never be able to find out it allows you a global reach as well which is why we see these conspiracy theories cropping up in other countries aswell i don t know if that sort of adjust what your question was in a major way yeah yeah yeah definitely it is this kind of if there s a notation that we are you also talked about different ways of propaganda you know and if it s quite well into that i guess yeah there s a larger background so to speak philosophical background i m thinking about now reaction is movement dark enlightenment you know those obscure philosophers such as you ll use a bola or or x and they re talking even so we could discuss it i think for the next an hour to see interesting coincidence yeah justin yeah i want i have a question for ben actually that i want to ask him my crops while i was reading his paper so this i don t want this to feel like a dip but it may be really curious so i hope you have an answer for me but it s about the psychology of scrolling so i was thinking of it right at the top where you talk about doing scrolling is this new compulsive behavior right so i wanted to ask is this is this really a new behavior because i was thinking about oliver wendell holmes senior not not the supremecourt justice this is father he wrote that i know this is the electronic literature foundation but bear with me this is about newspapers you wrote about the newspaper habit in in the atlantic he wrote about how this sort of perpetual inter inter inter communication which was joined to the power of instantaneous action keeps us alive with excitement there s not a single ball to the cubs best that we re about to know for a week of some great advancement it doesn t matter if it s true or false every hour early power graphs or laden with you know information and he concludes by saying that like only the bread and the newspaper the things that we have to have right everything else we could do without as a society that of course you know this coincided with another event like the pandemic that induced massive social upheaval that anxiety which was the civil war so i m wondering like what we re calling doom scrolling today could be possibly a manifestation of something more deeper that arises in human psychology whenever there s not enough information about something that s particularly titanic and the culture just throws us all into uncertainty and i you know you acknowledge that the endless scroll is like vastly more addicting these platform holders like complicit in a lot of horrible things that i don t want to discount that but i wonder how much of this would be occurring even without the algorithms like are we just programmed to do this for all of the end regardless ofthe error yeah thanks for that justin so a couple of a couple of responses that i would i would give one is that and i and i do go into some of this history in the paper didn t have time in the talk but is we it s been well studied that we have a predisposition a psychological predispositionto the negative that i mean this is what headline writers for all of time have been playing on is that a certain quality of negative in a headline grabs our attention more so than happy positive one i quoted in the paper you know if it bleeds it leads is the is the phrase that you hear in the news that merged in the s you know that anything negative is going to grab me and this has been looked at in network news and basically any kind of news space but when i thinkabout doom scrolling in the current era it s it s more than a predisposition to the negative because in the case of a newspaper it s a finite object per day it s a finite list of options in an order that was pre determined but it s fixed for all users you re not everybody gets a custom newspaper perfectly designed to keep them focused on the paper they get the paper and they get to play with it but in the cases of social media platforms it s not just that the content on the social media platform in the pandemic was perhaps the most activating for someone who is predisposed to the negative because it was global crisisexistential uncertainty you know threats to health etc but these were platforms that were watching every move that we make as a user using that analysis to give us precisely the right bad news headline next such that that one keeps us scrolling down to the next one and to the next one etc wendy i quit wendy china in the paper to who talks about the way that social media platforms produce neoliberal subjects who are always findalways searching never finding it puts us into these kinds of loops even end up talking in the paper about how we get turned almost transformed into a while loop thinking computationally where the stop condition is when there s no more to read or when we re no longer anxious and infinite scroll ensures there s always something more to read and profiling algorithmic profiling of the user in in the case of global pandemic or case of global uncertainty is ensures that will always be anxious it s like keeping the anxiety level up high enough that it just makes it very hard to as garrett loving says disk remember the exact quote but basicallymakes it really hard to disconnect from the system to disrupt our own behavior i think is how he puts it so anyway that s those are some thoughts of death i mean to me that quality is is a dramatic escalation of of this of this what we might calldoom scrolling and the previous era before algorithmic feeds yeah thank you so much um i think political and political environment and the epidemic actually the pandemic creates the environment where it happens and i m reminded by mark sample commented in a chat that for him and there s no scrolling started november and i think we all have local political moments when when does ender s game scholar happened also in europe in the country where i m based to but we still have three questions i would like to accommodate one from devin who is kind of a general question another one from magdalena and yet another one from christian so i hope we have enough time minutes so it should be okay to accommodatethe three question mentioned that in your question is a general one so and i understand that it is a question to all of the panelists right would you like to post it to yourself sure can you hear me okay yeah okay um so i was just wondering you know to what extent these platform experiences are you know inevitably producing these extreme behaviors i think what we just discussed was sort of along those lines and someonehad mentioned right before my comment i ve lost it now but they sort of also tend to listen to elicit an emotional response as well and i just wondered if the panelists would in their individual examples maybe have some insight on that thank you individually panelists to go ahead starting maybe with rachel know if you want to comment yeah i definitely think that platform design as you noted is intended to capture the attention and one of the things that can cause prolonged engagement which is what we re looking for so we want the advertisers to reach the largest audience possible part of the way that they do that is by enabling the formation of these sort of polarized polarized communities that one s here within them people tend to just reinforce each other s beliefs and push each other further to the extreme so i think that the way that the platform design impacts these individual users experiences is to facilitate the connection withother users with similar views i m not sure how it necessarily applies to tinder that s something i would have to think about because but the private nature of the communication on tinder that there s less i think of a tendency for the formation ofthese echo chambers but i definitely think that you could see similar things happening on reddit with a dedicated subreddit like our the donald and stuff like that like they form these insular communities and they re not in there encouraging healthy debate but instead are sort of just like bouncing off one another and pushing each other further to the right or the left in doing so which then encourages people to not only spend more time on the platform but also to like return to the platform again and again and again so i do think it s sort of intentional in the design thank you lauren would you like to add okay ben you ve already said i can actually speak a lot i mean i think i think there s a there s a slightly different flavor to the question if you don t mind just give a short comment because you know i hear the question really is about the youknow is polarization inevitable with these kinds of platforms and i very much believe the answer is no it s not inevitable simply having a social media platform doesn t produce polarization what produces polarization in the current conditions of the platforms we re all embedded in is the profit motive of the companies and the ideology of growth over everything else thatgrowth is the ultimate thing to be seeking and when that was two things are put together in the case of a facebook for example you end up with a system whose goal is to keep you on the system and in that case yeah i think polarization is often the outcome because one of the things that keeps people engaged is a polarizing opinion someone you know if you re on a social media platform and it s a ford and says focus you on your own metricsand your metric performance how many likes how many followers and then you want to see how to activate people to get more likes and followers it doesn t take very long to realize that saying something crazy outrageous is the thing that activates peopleto react and so polarization is often the outcome but that doesn t mean systems need to be designed that way a system could be designed for example in a way that discourages us rather than encourages us or tries to keep you know make people stay theleast amount of time rather than the most amount of time what s that sorry i heard a comment okay yeah so um so anyway so i don t think it s inevitable i m actually working on several new projects for an upcoming exhibition and in august so stay tuned actually have a platform that will be a part of that exhibition that maybe addresses that question more directly thank you so much i m looking forward to it and it is also very uplifting to hear that polarization is not inevitable i will keep this words as a kind of a model for the social media presence justin would you like to comment on this as well yeah response to the question whether the the alternate reality game platform is designed to encourage extreme behavior um i think the answer is no but like with anything it can be misused and because it hasn t historically been misused it s also a really beautiful new form right like you can trace it back to the s at the latest there just hasn t been a lot of time for it to be refined and then co opted and then refined again to prevent this use and i think that that s where we are right now now that designers or at least me i m telly designers are aware that like hey this stuff that we re doing is being misappropriated for like very bad we have a responsibility to understand how that s happening and try to not only refine the tools so that it makes it harder to do that but because obviously the genies out of the bottle we can t put it back in but how can we use these tools to produce counter programming programming either explicitly content designed to counteract what s being done or content that runs along opposite philosophical lines does things like increasesparticipation elections which is i think that s been going on for the past couple of years there are platforms in spain and taiwan across south america that use sort of these game logic to actually build democracies strength to strength of these systemsrather than break it down like we re seeing in the united states thank you very much and now question for magdalena to lauren and rachel would you like to ask a question yourself yes thank you thanks oh yeah my question really is i mean just to clarify because my question is really about gamified the users and and if you know that results in generating that friction that ben was talking about right so rather than making tinder tinder because as you say in your paper the intention of the of the tinder was to was to connect users to new matches the other choicesfrom playing right and so obviously it but it generated something a little bit opposite in a sense that that the players started to realize that perhaps that kind of is not going to go well in the future so i m curious as you talk about the way in which the users respond on other in other social media and i m curious if they also responded to tender if they kind of complained or if they sort of you know had had some question to day how a or if they wanted to repair something or their possible sort of algorithmic effect of their choices on who they might be matched with and so on i wondered if you had any results or information about that thanks yeah so we didn t particularly look to see if people had reached out directly to tinder for this study but i do know that people do try to like play the algorithm in tinder tinder faces itself mostly off of location first but things will happen like if you are swiping left on mostly people of color the people of color will stop showing up as often and you re like deck for you to look through or if you re swiping more on people who are a certain age they ll start showingup more often and so that s how the algorithm kind of works around um i do know that like a lot of people when they were commenting on the reddit what they were really afraid of was being like labeled as like not a good person or being perceived assomeone who would do something like cheat on a partner or cover for someone who is cheating and so it doesn t look like a lot of morality issues additionally a lot of people this was run twice so tinder swipe right was run the first time and october and then it was run a gun last summer i think it was in like august of and so a lot of people played it twice and were able to like change their answers because they had known already what it was going to do once and they were like well i don t like how that answer makes me be perceived so i m going to change it this timeand so that was also kind of their way to call back at tinder and out the algorithm as well so you like to add anything to that no i think lauren pretty much covered it is covered by lauren yeah thank you so much and we also have question from from christian for justin christian i think i think justin has already you kind of addressed what i was asking so i think i suggestedmove on to daniel because he s also got neil has already i think asked his question if you mean daniel cox who asked two questions okay yeah yeah so go ahead if you want to read your question actually this interesting sort of we still have we have different conversations going on around different topics so this is perhaps out of returning a bit to something that we were discussingearly on but i m just sort of extremely interested in how in how sort of the act of a protest a is shaped by by social media and other kinds of sort of not just social media but various kinds of social media media that construct social relations so so i have sort of a sort of an open question of how these how this has changed over the past decade because a decade ago you saw mid rossiter mpa blue beam criticizing the sort of so called twitter revolution said what revolutions or protest tiedto the hashtag and now you see something else which is perhaps tied tied to other mechanisms perhaps some of the mechanisms that ben also described and i wonder how that how that changes the act of a protest right its own loving they they for instance criticize the twitter revolutions for not having an organized network but yet you see in in japan on some some kind of organized network in this sort of new propaganda that you are outlining justin so what so it s more like sort of this speculative question and what what has changed and what and what remains the same and how does that how does that change the protest and sort of the individual s ability to imagine a sort of different alternativesocial future which i yeah i plus this this question immediately two panelists would like to chime in because i just recently practice in poland and around hashtag completed feminist what was called feminist revolution and i would like to brieflycomment that this notion of weak protest actually i use the notion of a week broadcast that concept conceptualized by the way by one of the famous philosophers from poland what she said actually she called it a week resistance was what she said was that this week resistance is something like you know felt like female kind of social activity which is not spectacular because we tend to you know we tend to associate revolutions withthose big spectacular gestures like like like i m like i m a steel or you know the beginning of a french revolution but the majority of the activity around twitter hashtags for example or this everyday digital activities could be named week resistancelike those acts of everyday activity on social media that often go under recognized because often they are confined with our for example chapter bots or you know reader bounce or those those mushy nick ways of intervening so so that will be my my very brief comment on is that as much as we despise the notion of the twitter revolution is you know kind of a category that was a bitsuperficial at the time and i think we should we shouldn t also go to the extremes there is still something to something interesting to to look on so yeah sorry about checking in but that was kind of a topic i wasn t interested in recently yeah ben go ahead now yeah no thanks man i m really appreciate hearing that it s i think the i think a big i mean to me with this makes me think about is that shifts in the focus of a social media platform can have dramatic effects on how protest plays out and certainly there s you know echoing the idea of activism the the way in which platforms produce a feeling for users that complaining about a political issue on social media or collectively complaining has some particular kind of effect but it doesn t necessarily usually doesn t just goesinto the ether and feeds the system but after the presidential election united states facebook changed its long standing mission statement of to make the world more open and connected into i don t remember what it is now but it s something about community to build community or something like that and along with that was a platform change which would heavily emphasize the local to show a lotmore local groups in one s feed and i think at this point that s pretty well acknowledged to have been a primary producer of the conditions that led to the one six insurrection at the capitol and united states the the way in which this kind of extremefocus on the local allows the festering and the organization of individuals into groups around fringe theory and fringe ideas and you know the more you re at your algorithmic feed identifies you as someone interested in a fringe theory the less it sgoing to show you alternatives to the fringe theory or in some cases that i m talking about reality well as it s going to show you reality and the more it s going to show you these are the things i think the key you know thinking a little bit about two movements that have organized over the last couple of years here one is the kind of q and on inspired insurrection organized around what we call the united states in themedia the big lie that trump actually won the election of and so i that one compared to say black lives matter which has had dramatic organization within social media platforms in ways that have affected some some significant refocusing in thecountry and in common with both of them is a combination of extreme interaction on social media but gathering in some way i think black lives matter is a more of a periodic gathering she went on was kind of a directed you know the the one six insurrection was a directed gathering towards that particular event and i won six insurrection produced what it produced and we can talk about it in detail i see it is pretty dramatically different from what black lives matter has produced so far in terms of its effect on change so that s maybe and we can do anyway those are some reactions i could probably go deep and really analyze but thank you so much was so interesting to hear the differences and not let s not forget that the capital events were sort of instigated by kind of alternative platforms likein famous popular and we re at the point where we can see the rise of outright platforms or reactionary platforms so that s also interesting issue in itself unfortunately we ve got one minute left so not much to continue the discussion
