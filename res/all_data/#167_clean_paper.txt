platforms for multilingual tele immersive storytelling and improvisation boyd branch university of kent united kingdom kory w mathewson improbotics canada piotr mirowski improbotics united kingdom boyd improvmedialab com korymath gmail com piotr mirowski computer org abstract in a pandemic caused a global shut down of the performance of live theatre this led to many artists without creative outlets many companies having to modify their programming and in an unfortunately large number of cases the complete shutdown of theatres and companies this circumscription led to a burst of technological innovation to support new ways to connect performers and audiences in this work we present two such innovations rosetta code and virtual director rosetta code is a tool for improvisation live or online which allows for simultaneous translation enabled by artiﬁcial intelligence the virtual director is a platform for tele immersive performance in the hands of multilingual cast members the virtual director augments rosetta code to create online multilingual improv shows we describe these platforms and provide descriptions and reﬂections on two performances of improbotics online which used the virtual director to bring together audience members and performers from around the world these performances were part of the paris fringe and improbotics online received positive reviews and an award for the most innovative show of the festival we conclude this work by discussing the potential for mixed presence international shows as we emerge from physical and social distancing requirements and how our tools will continue to support online and on site performances we have sparked a creative ratcheting effect performers are enabled to tell new and interesting stories and are inspired to suggest innovations which improve the tools with which they perform these innovations are deployed in future performances this positive feedback loop is a metaphor for the

helpful discussions equal contribution alphabetic order of authors introduction live theatre is a casualty of the current covid pandemic social and physical distancing requirements preclude assemblies necessary for participatory theatre these restrictions have signiﬁcantly reduced public performances pres sured many performing arts institutions to modify their programming and in many cases forced the complete shut down of arts organizations many of the world s most popular stages including all broadway theatres in new york usa and west end theatres in london united kingdom have plans to remain closed until at least the middle of early studies on the impact of social distancing restrictions on live arts professionals report substantial reductions in income for artists and increases in anxiety depression and overall mental health spiro et al the long term impact of shut tering theatres and the effects of social isolation on creativity in the performing arts industry remains to be seen while some performing artists have been able to shift to digital mediums to somewhat mitigate the impact on their creativity artists that rely heavily on the live presence of not only an audience but their fellow performers have had little recourse to maintain their craft improvisational art forms in particular have struggled to ﬁnd footing in digital mediums theatrical improvisation relies on performers and audiences gathering in the same space and using that shared phys ical proximity to collaboratively build stories the pandemic caused a global creative constipation through social and physical distancing requirements virtual gatherings using video conferencing platforms are at best an ersatz solu tion for audiences longing for connection in an ever more disconnected world these technologies have been linked to a phenomenon labelled zoom gloom or zoom fatigue which has been studied in several recent works bailen son fauville et al some improvisational theatre groups have embraced tele conferencing and streaming for workshops practice and performance but due to how demanding it is to set these sorts of systems up and the aforementioned zoom gloom which both performers and audiences are all too accustomed to many are preferring to temporarily pause while waiting for the conditions of performance to resume berger the live performance lim itation is a global issue the world wide community has been brought together online to share stories of adversity and challenge a list of improv theatres that shut down in has been circulated and updated over the last year has over theatres that have closed in the united states and canada alone johnson we believe that live theatre cannot wait for the pandemic to wane instead of re streaming previously recorded live performances we advocate for embracing technology and speciﬁcally innovative platforms for tele immersive storytelling and improvisation virtual director many live performers struggle with the desire to be as live and in the moment as possible while dealing with the physical impossibilities introduced by virtual improvisation the laws of physics that is the speed of light deﬁnes a theoretical maximum for the speed of information transfer this is the maximum rate at which information from one performer can reach another performer or an audience observer when audience and performer are co located in a theatre this information can happen at the speed of sound for jokes laughter and applause and at the speed of light for body language and scenic painting when performers are not co located with audience members it takes a non insigniﬁcant amount of time for the information round trip to occur while this is generally under a half second it can feel like a lifetime thus platforms must be designed in such a way to handle issues of latency and lag introduced by these delays and as the number one rule in comedy is timing handling these issues effectively is paramount for translating the comedy from the performers to the observers theatres around the world have tried countless ways to incorporate live and prerecorded content for performance host ing and audience interaction but the platforms often stand in the way rather than uplift these tools need to be easy enough for performers to use and improve audience enjoyment to handle these requirements we built a platform for online performance our system called the virtual director enables actors to simulate feelings of presence with stage partners while performing and storytelling remotely branch et al our research combines cinematic and video communication technologies with the theatrical practice of improvisational and scripted theatre and aims at recreating presence virtually virtual director relies on commodity software i e touchdesigner and web browsers such as google chrome widely adopted video conferencing tools e g zoom microsoft teams and popular streaming platforms e g youtube twitch our solution piggy backs on these digital platforms for streaming and video conferencing for participatory online performances this makes using the tools as easy as using common consumer software these technologies have evolved signiﬁcantly with a year of development and global dependence for tele work and remote education software such as open broadcaster software obs obs ninja and even zoom s and

the virtual director software while a full system description is out of the scope for this particular work we encourage readers to see branch et al for complete details next we discuss how the virtual director system was tested with small live public performances featuring a variety of improvisational teams and performances with improbotics online at the paris fringe festival early public trials while developing virtual director we conducted two trials of the platform in front of live audiences with short per formances from four different improv theatre teams the teams were solicited from an open call for two person improv teams who had been working together for at least a year and were interested in trying out new tools for streaming perfor mance each team trained with the software for two weeks prior to performing for small audiences who watched the live shows from within a zoom conference call twinprov and the jess s s s performed for the show double incidentally may for audience members sudden knot and assimilate performed for digital improv presents june th the following month for audience members each team performed for approximately minutes we conducted surveys after each performance and received responses twelve of the thirteen respondents agreed or strongly agreed to feeling present with the performers as well as agreeing they could easily visualize the world created by the performers demonstrating that the platform was successful in bringing a sense of cohesion and shared presence between remote participants answers to our open ended questions yielded a more nuanced appreciation of the impact of the technology on the potential of live streamed performance we include the following quotes from audience members a a for discussion answering how did you feel about the presence of the technology in the show it was certainly interesting and the visuals helped to create an extra dimension for us as the audience a really engaging and the connections between performers particularly stood out a https www facebook com twinprovimprov https www facebook com jesssssimprov it was terriﬁc the second part with the ﬁlter was super cool and i loved seeing them on green screen as well as in the virtual environment it was distracting but not detracting if that makes sense and really the distraction pulled me in deeper a i felt i was a part of it especially at the top and end there is something powerful for an audience member to share the screen with the performers a felt great would be awesome to have ongoing cues or coordination where artists knew the bounds of the technology and explored it more a i would like to see actors working more in different levels of the virtual space playing with their size inside the screen could be really engaging for the audience and both challenging and exciting for actors a it was something i was aware of but it added to the feel and vibe of the show even when things didn t work as well as you might have hoped it all just added to the fun a the range of responses we share capture both the sense of pleasure audience members expressed in being part of a visually co located performance as well how the presence of technology stimulated their imaginations about what might be possible with a platform that could immerse audiences and performers inside a shared visual space performances at the paris fringe festival we deployed virtual director within the context of an improbotics online show as part of the community based per formances at the online paris fringe festival improbotics started as a research and performance project exploring turing s imitation game using machine intelligence in improvised theatre turing mathewson and mirowski mirowski and mathewson to ensure that the audience understood the context for the performance the descrip tion of the show was as follows improbotics online is a fully online live improvised performance in an immersive virtual reality stage where human improvisers interact with artiﬁcial intelligence we performed the show twice on the th and st of june the show won a ballsy award and was also awarded the most innovative show at the paris fringe the performance received a four out of ﬁve star review on june and the complete text of the review is included for context as an appendix to this work we include a quote from the review here for discussion the translation of the stage show into an online performance was not entirely seamless however i do not feel it is important to mark improbotics online down for this as a lot of the witty and interesting moments occurred during the slight awkward panic of being live and online jake mace this review acknowledges that even the unique moments when the performance was not seamless were still interesting this delightful balance between everything is under control and potential panic is delight inducing from an audience point of view in a way this risk is analogous to the ring of ﬁre that a trapezist would leap through in the big tent at a circus johnstone to see the show we have posted a short trailer and a full performance accessible at https improbotics org online in the next section we brieﬂy describe several interesting qualitative observations that we synthesized from the audience members and performers during and after these performances performer audience interaction we now examine the perception of the performance by audiences and their participation in collective storytelling our audience was interested in the new interaction formats and performance modalities presented as part of improbotics on line our streamed performances redeﬁned the nature of live performance and we identiﬁed levels of participation participating as a performer privileged audience member general audience member onlookers watching the show recording post performance we brieﬂy summarize each of these modes of participation comparing and contrasting the qualitative experiences first our tool enabled visual collocation and presence among performers these are the professional improvisors who perform the show they represent the cast of performers second virtual director enabled visual collocation and audio interaction between selected privileged audience member and the performers or recreated visual presence if we placed them in a virtual amphitheatre third general audience members audiences could interact indirectly via synchronous chat https improbotics org https twitter com leparisfringe status finally onlookers can watch or re watch the performance as we post the recording of the performance to the internet for asynchronous enjoyment our initial study on the impact of visual co location on remote improvised demonstrated how being visually co located enhanced the sense of presence with remote scene partners in a way that traditional grid arrangements of popular conference tools did not subjects of the study reported how this sense of presence with each other contributed to their ability to enter into a state of ﬂow during performance that in turn led to enhanced feelings of creativity and the idea that online improvisation could be an entirely new medium distinct from physically staged improvisation branch et al we noted a similar idea emerging from our audience feedback about how online performance could be considered a new medium with different rules and expectations from physically staged performance the extra dimension of a shared visual environment for one audience member that added to their enjoyment was the same dimension leading another to imagine how the addition of dynamic visual environments could be better exploited with actors working more in different levels of the virtual space traditional improvisation is bound by physical laws that digital improvisers are not inherently bound to meaning space now has additional expressive potential as performers can appear bigger or smaller taking up space in new ways that impact storytelling during our initial audience study we experimented with keeping the audience visually present throughout different moments of the show by instructing them to keep their cameras and microphones on the feeling that there is something powerful for an audience member to share the screen with the performers was echoed by another who reported my attention felt more present and necessary co locating all audience members with performers during shows streamed to larger audiences on social media platforms such as youtube however cannot take advantage of webcams the way video conferencing tools can so require different methods for engaging with audiences for our paris fringe shows we instead explored how live chat could be incorporated into performances we added functionality to virtual director that could display the results from a web server that audience members could send suggestions to in addition to commenting with each other during performances via the built in chat functions of youtube curated suggestions from both sources would then appear inside the virtual environment inhabited by the performers between scenes these different modes of interaction are all complimentary to the performance experience they all contributed to a sense of collaborative collective storytelling in a shared space as a performer you need to consider the performance from each of these perspectives and understand how to engage with these perspectives in the moment additional analyses of the performers experience of presence in tele immersive virtual spaces is covered in work by branch et al having tools such as the virtual director accessible to us and rehearsing and performing with them led to a creative ratcheting effect the more that we shared these tools with brilliant performers and professional improvisors the more interesting and innovative ideas they had to tune and modify them and use them in interesting ways for instance the shared virtual environments of online rehearsals and performances with virtual director resemble cinema much more than theatre and led to the novel adoption of cinematic techniques for improvised storytelling during rehearsals improvisers began exploring how they could move props on and off screen make their heads disappear by placing green fabric in front of their faces and composite their bodies onto each other by overlapping their images on screen with virtual director performers can not only enter and exit the playing space by moving off camera but they can also reference and incorporate physical props and costumes dynamically into scenes as they develop our platform also provided the addition of a virtual camera as another scene partner that could interact with the performance the environments of virtual director are built inside a d environment where performers are placed on transparent digital planes sandwiched between foreground and background elements which can subsequently be viewed from different angles this allowed us to incorporate virtual camera controls to our platform so that an operator could pan and zoom into different areas of the screen like a sitcom or movie in addition to new cinematic techniques virtual performance also led to novel incorporation of communication tools that bridged not only physical distance but language barriers prior to the pandemic improbotics had long been adapting technology from state of the art language models to digital avatars to translation systems to explore how humans can improvise with technology mathewson and mirowski in physically co located shows the role of these technolo gies could often be difﬁcult for audiences to distinguish with online performances however we discovered not only how we could make these novel tools more visually present but how we could incorporate them more meaningfully into performance figure examples of the immersive multi performer virtual stage combined with real time translation for two perform ers who are not physically co located and who are speaking in two different languages dutch and polish with live transation into english the real time masking and composition is done by the virtual director software combined with the google speech recognition and translation apis multilingual performance and actor interaction as an international theatre troupe improbotics has cast members representing multiple nationalities and languages in we began exploring novel multilingual improvisational formats by exploiting live translation and speech recogni tion technology in a show called rosetta code using google s api for speech recognition for real time translation and for text to speech generation we built a pro gram to listen to improvisers speaking in a language foreign to their scene partner s and to send them the near real time translation via headset as well as to display the result of speech recognition and of real time translation on a screen in this way we enabled actors to improvise in multiple languages while being understood by cast members and audiences the show was performed on stage in november at the rich mix theatre in london as part of the voila festival of european theatre mirowski mathewson et al while we had some successes with this format it could at times be difﬁcult for audiences to track how the translations were taking place as we relied on projections that did not always sync smoothly with the performance moreover captur ing the speech of individual performers without cross talk from their stage partners proved challenging and required them to hold a dynamic microphone with an on off switch in their hand moving to an online platform with virtual director not only began to solve many of these challenges for example speech recognition could be run independently on each performer s computer but also introduced new ways to incorporate translations into the show our original system which enabled a low latency multilingual experience for performers and audiences alike chal lenged contemporary theatre which is often performed and enjoyed in a single language building up on an existing multilingual improv stage show mirowski mathewson et al we combined tele immersion with translation to create a multilingual performance that transcends typical physical limitations of the stage as the performers spoke in different languages real time translation of their lines was displayed on the screen like the subtitles in a foreign ﬁlm the cohesive environment of the virtual stage enabled us to use subtitling more effectively so that audiences could see the translations and the performance simultaneously in a way that projections alone could not do moreover the addition of virtual environments meant we could provide a more cohesive narrative experience and con text for multilingual improv with performers appearing to be in the same physical location when performing in phys ically co located shows the stage is empty and requires improvisers to not only spontaneously generate meaningful dialogue but also verbally paint the visual environment of the scene through that dialogue with multilingual per formance it there is a signiﬁcant cognitive demand on both performers and audiences to keep track of physical details being described throughout the scene and there is subsequently little agreement about the physical reality of the space performing tele presently with virtual director meant performers and audiences could immediately understand where the scene was taking place alleviating much of that cognitive burden https richmix org uk events rosetta code discussion and conclusions one consideration is that our system de centers the place of the actors on the digital stage no longer is there a human front and center but rather there is a window sometimes quite literally a digital window within which performers are co located this has a potential to shift the audiences focus from the acting and emotion of the live performer to the technological choices that are supporting the experience while this risk is real we have found that the balance enables us to explore mixed human machine storytelling in a way that would otherwise not be possible that is we are able to have humans and machines perform scenes together and it looks and feels similar to having two humans perform together this delicate balance on the cusp of the uncanny valley is a fun and playful experience for performers and it allows us to tell stories that are otherwise more demanding on the audiences suspension of disbelief once we assemble again in a post pandemic world we will keep the tele immersion and translation tools to create mixed presence connected international shows what we aimed to do with our virtual director work was not to repeat or replicate the experience the interactive and embodied experience in a shared theatre setting rather we aimed to augment the creativity and storytelling capabilities of human performers with technology that can be used in multiple settings mirowski and mathewson these tools will enable the next generation of on site improvisational theatre as well performers will be able to build immersive lighting visual and audio experiences in the moment and from the stage audiences will be empowered to immerse themselves in the collective creation of the show through textual interaction through their voices or even by moving around the space these platforms are built in such a way that they can easily be adopted by improvisational theatres anywhere on earth we are already sharing this technology with other performers around the world these groups have engaged with out platforms to enable their shows this global impact is a testament to the impact of platform development finally as we slowly and cautiously migrate back into the theatres our technologies will continue to enable live theatre

this review was posted to bingefringe com june and is authored by jake mace in events reminiscent of a mix between a franz kafka novel and an episode of black mirror written on an acid trip alex the artiﬁcially intelligent avatar has joined an improv troupe alex s automatically generated lines are slotted https bingefringe com review improbotics online paris fringe into the architecture of stories created by audience suggestions through a website these suggestions are then beamed back to youtube in the style of a raoul hausmann collage as the bodies of the improvisers are inserted into different backgrounds by virtual director boyd branch improbotics online was split into sections in the ﬁrst alex is inserted directly into the scene creating some incredibly surreal interaction between a photorealistic ai cat and a man who just wants to swim in the second section two hander scenes are played out by the improvisers but one s body is inhabited by alex becoming a cyborg and only speaking lines generated by the robot possibly the most entertaining section of the show took the form of a narrative across many scenes where one of the improvisers was a cyborg and the audience has to guess which this led to a hysterical moment where in the middle of an intense scene about a woman who suspects her boyfriend has been cheating on her while he s at the gym improviser harry turnbull seemingly inhabited by alex blurts out the line the number of troops in afghanistan in the past three years has risen directly in tandem with president obama s strategy other standout lines from the ai include i m your mum you re my brother what do you think of my dad and i m an alcoholic so i don t mind alex either intentionally or unintentionally seems hellbent on disrupting any scene that they are dropped into the middle of the translation of the stage show into an online performance was not entirely seamless however i do not feel it is important to mark improbotics online down for this as a lot of the witty and interesting moments occurred during the slight awkward panic of being live and online if anything the online show seemed to thrive on the anarchy that the format provided all of the performers showed excellent form to carry the show through despite being scattered all over the world live suggestions from the audience were integrated into the show s last segment and the performers seem to feed per fectly off of these as well as bouncing around alex s chaos bringing presence the narrative of this ﬁnal segment took many surprising turns it eventually landed on the story of a grunt being sent by a wizard to ﬁnd him a scandinavian wife as he had turned his previous girlfriend into a pumpkin spiced latte while in the starbucks queue his quest leads us to a woman who still bathes with her forty one year old adult son on their ﬁrst date the wizard gets cold feet and turns himself into a cat before through a number of tangential encounters lead us back to some sort of conclusion the implementation of the ai into these traditional improv troupe games is genius and the pace of the event doesn t skip a beat even in between the monumental technical efforts undertaken to splice each player into a scene this is exactly the kind of response that the creative world will have to look towards as we continue to learn to live with the current tricky situation regarding lockdowns and restrictions on how readily artists can perform together and in front of live audiences overall the show was raucous fun pure anarchy and a dystopian vision of an artiﬁcially intelligent future where the turing test might be decided by how readily you can hold back your views about the deployment of us troops into the middle east improbotics online is not to be missed this paris fringe a second performance will be held on the paris fringe youtube channel on the st june at paris time for absolutely free you can read more about future improbotics performances
