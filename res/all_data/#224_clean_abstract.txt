 larps are a form of analog game in which participants co create and collectively inhabit diegeses montola larp may also be thought of as a medium and codic larps are a type of larp platform that use diegetic code steele to represent parts of the story allowing conflicts about what happens next to be resolved through contests in which diegetic material has been congealed into code and rendered deployable codic larps offer a unique opportunity to teach and study code and the analog nature of codic larp allows advanced engagements like platform modding to happen with fewer layers of technology to navigate than digital code platforms ostensibly lowering the barrier of entry to coding while allowing diegetic code to serve as a boundary object star through which scholars and professionals from many backgrounds may develop common language to engage in cross codic critique recently activities including as codic larps have come under scrutiny by those who question the power relations inherent in physically embodying one s own avatar as well as in rituals surrounding the embodied deployment of diegetic code after developing and touring their digital shakespeare game _play the knave_ gina bloom nicholas toothman and evan buswell have recently argued that having players physically embody their characters is troubled by the degree to which out of game asymmetrical power relations like racisms and sexisms attach themselves to bodies bloom et al an issue that is part of a phenomenon that might be called out of game creep additionally sociologist steven dashiell has criticized rituals that often surround code based analog gaming for reinforcing structural forms of sexism and other inequalities fueling arguments within larp communities that diegetic code deployment should be removed from games altogether cf fatland et al seeming to push back against these sentiments is the work of other gamemaker scholars who have engaged larp s embodiment and rituals of code deployment to ostensibly develop interventions into pervasive forms of systemic inequality jonaya kemper s work on emancipatory bleed diana shipley s efforts to develop anti racist scaffolding for codic larp as well as the work i have done on anti code and the efforts to develop larp consent mechanics by johanna koljonen sarah lynne bowman and maury brown demonstrate efforts to not only salvage different facets of the larp medium but to fork the code using the larp medium s unique embodimemt and of code based play to offer game mechanics and scaffolding as interventions into systemic racisms and sexisms elo
