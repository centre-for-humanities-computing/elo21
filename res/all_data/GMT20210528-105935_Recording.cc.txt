i continue to experiment with it and stuff after after like a few hours we will have right was with dana larsen where if you join i will talk more about it and ellen said where i have been trying to create the electronic signature collection so that is also an important source so you can identify how things are working out and if you have been in the draft exhibit just before this you might have at some point is there as well okay now coming to the very end i won t take much any more time so the possibilities is where we can go further now i talked about electronic india right so in terms of india the group which exists in whatsapp at this point but because our country s going to start a humanitarian crisis we re using the group to collect resources that help each other out you need to collect oxygen or give them hospitalbeds because yes academic is important but it is even more important for people to be alive yeah my deals are given and i will be really love to talk anytime so yeah thank you so much so our next speaker is susie cronin who is a scholar of any french literature based in cork ireland at the moment it s such an interesting situation where you never know where people actually are their institutional affiliations and where people are from and then there areplaces where they happen to be at the moment so yeah wonderful but also disorienting for me and you and i are not so hard for me but it feels like you know you could be in any time zone or anywhere anyway go ahead susie thanks so much and so i ll just preface my discussion by saying that i m not actually affiliated with an institution at the moment and i m not researching full time but i did come across and i m going to start sharing my screenand probably quite clumsy lisa and share screen so i m currently looking at migrant narratives and the ways in which these sort of contribute to and let me just find the button because i know little faces are over present and i shouldn t try and speak and coordinate myself at the same time can everyone see my screen perfect good thank you so much perfect good thank you so much and yes okay so i m currently looking at the way in which online communities are formed and the way in which the iterations of community then have sort of repercussions for understanding of mobility and privilege andtravel in the present so as part of that sort of interest strand this is something that i developed following a reading the iom world migration report in and to see that migrant narratives have been rendered in expressive digital forms so thatis to say narrative forms that operate for the purpose of storytelling so we have instances of apps such as the italian app working which is a slightly gamified up that is designed to allow migrants to navigate the job market in europe but i thinkthe two apps that i look at here survival and very my love both produced in or interesting for this kind of purity of storytelling intention and the idea that they re purely for narrative purposes they re both gamified to they re both sort of designed in such a way that they are engaging user interactivity and they use the game form but in sort of a non traditional way as i explore here so because of the shortness of the discussion i m just going to cherry pick some of the points and i was skeptical initially when i read this was my presentation on moving sothere we go apologies so i was skeptical initially about this idea of the serious game in inverted commas so that s how survival presents itself on it s google app store homepage and then i found the concept of retail release persuasive game useful here so the persuasive game is that is designated as an art practice or a piece of instructive art more so than sort of marketable product designed as an enjoyable destruction fromthe real world and and so really emphasizes the particular aptitude of the persuasive game form for dealing with political themes such as labor migrants and war and so i find this quite a constructive sort of avenue to look at some of the problematic surrounding categorizing this kind of material and i looked also at the way in which empathy is generated and we won t kind of have time to look into other platformssuch as instagram for example but i think it s interesting to look at the capacity of migrant centered content and content created and by and for people on the move as a force that can sort of regenerate and refresh and contribute positively to our perception of what migrant experience is and i think as has arisen in sort of previous discussions in different panels the mobile phone kind of keeps rising as one ofthe most democratic side of platforms for and the sharing of digital narrative so i think this fact that both of the narratives i explore here are published on phone apps is really powerful in the sense that it creates this kind of as even as possibleaccess and let me see so i ll skip forward a little bit because i m conscious of time this is the homepage of survival so it shows the sort of six thumbnails that and describe the six levels i was gonna say chapters i ve got to internalize the narrative too much so survival is an app that s held in landscape rotation on the phone so it s kind of redolent of this kind of game boy format and the gamification does mean that the up simplifiessomewhat that kind of characterization and other aspects of sort of narrative development and so its capacity to generate entity is kind of surrendered a little bit to fitting in with the game for him and i think that s part of the fact that it s generatedas a collaborative project that i believe did not receive so much funding but they ve done very well in order to create a piece that raises awareness that s freely available and that represents what can be done when sort of migrant communities and localsin inverted commas because i think that term is also quite a strangely tokenizing work together in order to create something that allows people to navigate and i think it was faulted in some of the reviews for its simplicity and i think in some ways the way in which it s set up as a game has caused issues with some users were one of the user of using the google play store reads i like it but why does theboat level have to take so long so i think the empathy is blocked somewhat by the extent to which the game is created as a game in which the goal is to move through things sort of seamlessly and i m conscious of time i m probably exploiting the time limit a little bit so do stop me please and if i m going over a very me my love is a much more sort of developed project in the sense that there are multiple sort of organizations involved sothe pixel hunt i de france and fakes and it s inexpensive it s not free to download it s also available on the app store and you have a sense of the aesthetics from this and part of the advertisement for baby my love characterization is much more developed it takes the form of instant messaging between nora who is a migrant woman from syria undertaking a sort of clandestine journey to turkey there are a number of differentsort of strands of the narrative so depending on how you choose to respond you normally have two options so you re you as the user are interrupting as much who s no noise husband and the narrative and the tone is very sort of ludic so i think the titlevery me my love comes across as a little bit alarming to a non arabic speaker but it s sort of colloquialism that is quite a common place way of saying goodbye so i think then by contrast to this kind of quite large title and the actual vernacular of the narrative itself is quite playful and in some ways quite americanized so there is a little sense and that we need to pro here as well as to what degree wordsare being placed in the characters mode what s being lost or gained in translation but that s a whole other discussion for someone with a bit more arabic proficiency so the narrative in twins itself in the temporality of instant messaging the absence push notifications to the user the way in which the user has to experience delays sort of then parallel the way in which measured has to wait on updates from newer there s a degree of uncertainty and suspense experienced from these delays so i think this does work really effectively in order to generate sort of a sense of empathy with someone in the position of being separated from a loved one who s undertaking a migratory trajectory and there s also a lot of discussion of the kinds of issues that are encountered am i doing okay for time to have yeah i think everyone s just being kind i think i m probably running over so neuro occasionally cuts the conversation short where you have issues such as low battery and so there is this kind of paralleling of the user with measured who s based at their home he has the stability where he s not sort of am subjected to the same kind of restrictions measured is also sort of freely able to browse information so for instance you ll hear from norway she s in croatia and she sees a huge demonstration or blockage and from my perspective he is the one who s able to browse for con for news content or updates and that might give him some context as to why that is and so you can feel noise kind of apprehension and the restrictions on her in terms of not allowingher phone battery today because she s never quite sure how much is left so there is a very real sense of sort of urgency and also limitation here i think these delays really generate investment in the narrative for any user that is sort of earnestlyengaging with the narrative i think there is a really successful sort of sense of investment and i think the way in which the push notifications are sent to the user s phone mean that they re sort of accorded attention there s a decision actively beentaken each time in this attention economy whereby this narrative deserves attention this narrative deserves sort of investment on the part of the user i ll skip ahead just to my concluding remarks because i think we should sort of start to wrap up and then again i ve mentioned this before the phone is an intersection between practicality and entertainment urgency and distraction and it kind of operators quite a democratic platform choice so i think the mobile app narrative has a huge amount of potential for narratives in terms of diffusing widely and diffusing in a democratic way i return to the persuasive game notion will no doubt prove fruitful in gaining a fuller understanding of the game from beyond lunatics and operating more intentionally as a catalyst for change and i look as well in the paper at games for change an organizationthat looks at specifically grouping together or sort of indexing games that have a social context or social justice sort of context and intention and finally to small things i m wondering whether and this might be very reductive for scholars with more sort of proficiency in video game studies but whether the persuasive game in the traditionally held perception of video games form as rooted in fantastical escapism and insteadengages the player in urgent emotion and confrontation with real world issues and that s sort of an open ended question that will just sort of feed into further probing of this persuasive game idea in relation to not only migrant narratives but alsolgbt q sort of narratives and the scope of the video game as a mode of exploring empathy and understanding community building and community solidarity here and finally looking at the title of this panel platform possibilities and beyond i m interested in the way in which migrant narrative can capture and express itself the way in which migrants can use social media platforms to re center the dialogue thatoften is kind of appropriated by journalism and is often sort of em prescriptive in the sense that news platforms will often dictate what kind of content they want to use in order to mobilize a particular vision of migrants so i think this kind of capacityfor migrants to re center themselves within their own narratives is something that represents quite a powerful potential and i think it s quite exciting to see this appearing in the realm of digital literature as we kind of talked more and more aboutequality of representation and looking at communities were annoyed engaging in digital points so thank you so much for listening i kind of skipped over the last slides apologies one stop screen sharing that thanks very much susiefairly well on time with with powerful questions as well so we should be okay just a warning because my i keep getting warnings that my connection is unstable and my screen freezes a little bit every now and then so i m not planning to disappear but if i drop off line for a second so don t be alarmed i will be back as soon as possible great thanks susie and we have one more speaker in this panel and gods julian hannah and assistant professor in tilburg university in the netherlands at the moment if i understand correctly and yeah go ahead union and we ll have a conversationand questions afterwards and afterwards i ll just share my screen here that can you see that okay can you hear me and see everything and everything s good okay good so as you can see my papers called pandemic and protest revolution and reflection and it s about the online manifesto from the past or months basically as you ll see i kind of stuck to the brief of the pandemic timeline pretty closely so i ll start by saying i hope this finds you well in a way that we ve gotten used to say this is just a glimpse of the full version obviously so kind of starting from this point of view of taking the manifesto as the kind of genre of the avant garde and it also kind of is reflecting in often encouraging crisis points and upheaval in politics and society and the arts there s been a lot of great scholarship on the manifesto but most of it was written before so it s starting to get its you know just as social media was getting started so it s it s getting slightly out of date and that s the kind of gap i m tryingto fill but in this case i m just starting i m just focusing really on the pandemic period so this was strange timing i think manifestos definitely thrive in years like the one we ve just had the times of uncertainty and promise as well i wrote about some of these themes in the manifesto handbook there on the left which came out in february on the eve of the pandemic and then the very next month brianna fires excellent anthology burn it down feminists manifestos for the revolution was published by versa so neither of us got a book tour as far as states in our introduction we ve returned again to a period of cultural reckoning people who wants to on the sidelines are jumping into the fray and through mainstream social media platforms as well as niche and alternative online spaces the manifesto is reclaimed its function as a primary marker of history but whether analog or digital manifesto has always been serving very diverse movementsand ends so i started collecting manifestos even more than usual at the beginning of the pandemic and i was keeping a sort of hybrid pandemic protest manifester diary so the paper is divided chronologically and moves through the four seasons or five seasons beginning and ending in spring it was the year of reflection and reevaluation in the spring of followed by action and upheaval in the summer followed by frustration and promises of change in the autumn followed by reaction and acceleration engineer collapse in the winter you remember followed by mounting fatigue delirium and finally some hope for the future with the arrival of spring and vaccinations so to start with spring if there s one manifesto that s emblematic of the tone of spring it must be the self quarantine manifesto lunch from the website stayed at home the blind impractical open source manifesto describes itself as a set of loose guidelines for people who wish to join the movement and take action that can actually make a difference and other high profile manifested from march it takes the form of the questionnaire although there s still some kind of combative manifesto rhetoric in there for example he says now is the time for the annual stock take when common sense asks us to start production up again as quickly as possible we have to shout back absolutely not seizing the opportunity for change at the outset of the pandemic latour asks what are some suspended activities that you would like to see not coming back in the arts lockdown i conditions in the first place prompted an accompanying wave of manifestos so there were for example he flex magazines letters against separation three magazines am in lockdown series and many others sought to provide a space for conversations that were no longer taking place in person and then on another another level they kind of became this kind of space for larger conversations about art or writing in general and how we create and how we live in now we want to live going into the summer suddenly as we all saw in the news and many of us witnessed in the streets another type of manifesto and manifestation was dominating headlines so the depth of george floyd a year ago this week on the th of may captured in a nine minute and second video led to protests that were not only nationwide but in the us butworldwide in june as you can see here several blocks blocks of seattle s capitol hill were declared an autonomous zone by protesters who issued a manifesto with more than demands black lives matter drafted a new list of seven demands including defend the police and then at the same time citizen video had been vastly improving over the past couple of years and people were getting to know how to use technology and how to act in front of the camera and at the same time we re all becoming more critical as viewers and as a result some of the best manifestos in this we could see this last summer are kind of viral videos up spontaneously composed and shot in the thick of the action not dimension on appearing on tick tock so countless videos of speeches from protesters and community leaders appeared online during the summer of and this is plainly a new form of making manifest it sarah ahmed rights in the labor of making manifest we make a manifesto of course the foil for these protests videos is the police brutality video one of which ignited some of the biggest protests in us history of course during ella fraser s video of george fluids murder in minneapolis frazier her video literally made manifest and kind of bore witness and bore brought facts to light it contradicted the official police statement that was issued after floyd s death and led to the eventual trial and conviction of derek schulman whereit was used as a key piece of evidence i m going to skip that the long running reality tv program that was the us presidential election reached its finale in november shifting into autumn more than ever this sort of manifesto ease became the norm on social media platforms with everyone trading slogans and kind of attacking each other new platforms like parlor and gab and rumble popped up that would become even more popular as prominent figures on the right were banned from mainstream platforms particularly on the right among academics and students and digital workers of all kinds meanwhile a very tangible zoom fatigue which you may be familiar with began to sit in this is artist and educator michelle cast presents video empty empty video chat manifesto which declares we refuse to fake human presence she makes a passionate plea for non visual communication this is obviously just a bit of it she says he hears my voice listen it s full of unquantifiable information it is human soft real so no no video today or tomorrow you ll remember what i look like when we meet again winter brought a new wave of the pandemic across europe in the us and elsewhere and there was this general sense of upheaval and near collapse both in terms of pandemic and protest the letter could be seen in the january invasion by trump supporters of the us capitol a stark reminder that manifestos are not by any means necessarily progressive and neither is the counterculture just to wrap up with spring almost halfway through it s hard to argue that everything is fine so the question is maybe how can manifest those help what i hope to see going forward is more collaboration more experimentation fewer boilerplate manifestos after marks and marin eddie and thinking about in shaping the future and forming communities these are some of the manifestos great strengths and sometimes they all come together so you have the future vision the practical social artistic application and the community forming and getting behind a manifesto um so that s more or less if i may just really quickly it s not directly directly related to the pandemic but of course there were many other kinds of manifestos that kept popping up during the year that weren t related to the pandemic or the protestsand a striking example just kind of in formal or technical terms of what s possible is rosa maintenance she did the glitch studies manifesto from about a decade ago and her latest manifesto which was published in a book in at the start of the pandemic she has this manifesto this ird manifesto that s critical of institutional failures and it takes the form of these five apparently inscrutable panels that require de encrypting to read and each panel depicts the different tenants of the manifesto and in the book containing the manifesto it ends with a quote from dr horowitz the cyborg manifesto which i think is still a key influence for the current generation of cyber feminists so i just wanted to put that out there it s an interesting example and there s more in the paper of course thank you very much hope i didn t go too much over thank you very much julian it s that s great and we are still on schedule and we re still also a schedule of having one more presentation in this panel i think there was a slight mix up with with the schedule but since everybody has been keeping to their time fairly well that s that s not going to cause a problem so we have another presentation to look forward to which is by karen i m done a key on on the summing up seattle and i believe our presenters are are here on the stage is yours thank you thank you very much and yeah and to the other presenters and and the audience and we appreciate squeezing i see and i wonder whether we should just simply move along with this without a presentation of the screen we were presenting some research that we have probably been conducting now for about a year year and a half starting with some research that we were doing for that barcelona agency i wonder whether we re still under an nda phenomena i don t know anyways so into social media so one of the questions that we started to ask ourselves was with this kind of forced experiment in in online existence that was we were wondering about these spaces that were once occupied by individuals and artists and and practitioners in electronic literature becoming eclipsed by social media platforms and we started to think a little bit about what happens inside those spaces when an artist or writer begins to work in those spaces so we we started working on the app is not the territory and writing to the edge of platform ism so the research itselfis a typical for us we we generally we generally make things first and then we post the arise so we re you know with with sort of writing this research we started off with the idea of platforms and so we talked a little bit about platform ism and we try and establish some arguments around platform ism as an ideology that we wanted to look at platform ism as an ideology because it seems to haveas andy was saying it s eclipsed the use of the world wide web it has taken the audience away obviously well repositioned as as all of the examples we ve seen today in this panel have shown artists obviously thriving even in these spaces and we re not denying that at all what we re saying though is that perhaps in the rush to occupy and to work within these spaces there may be there may not have been enough time to reflect on what the performances and challenges of platform ism are like what are we doing inside platform is and how is it changing the artist and the and the creative practitioner so we wanted to establish that platform ism the platform is we call it platform ism and we believe very strongly that it is an ideology obviously this is reflecting on echoing work by loving and wendy chan and this suggestion has been made that this is we are in an ideology when we re in these applications on our smartphones because there is a certain control hegemony of the structureand of the formal spaces and of the template and there s no no control over the over the writing spaces and the communication spaces by the user and so and at the same time we are perceiving our world in a different way if we are performing or creatingwithin social media with our life activity so in the end the platform or the system of platforms through the device and the app and the other users controls our perception it is logical in its form it controls our actions or it encouraged us to act in particular ways and and these are all the signs that point to platform isn t being an ideology if you frame it in this way so we so i m skipping that page then we establish that sorry so so all right so we re talking about we re talking about an ideology and list let s take that as a premise what we re starting to really think about at this point and i think a good example of this is a scene from friends the tv series in which all the characters visit london this would be very quick so if you can indulge this example chandler and and joey exit from the hotel in london and joy is you probably know the same it s quite well known but if you don t joy is disoriented and needs to find himself in the in the territory he opens up a map and he says i know i m going to have to get into the map he lays the map on the ground and he steps into this map i hope you can see this little the screen that i m that we re talking on top of here this was a really interesting same for us it s this mary poppins moment sort of jumping into kind of drawings on the ground and entering into a new reality we see joe instead kind of bodily moving into the the the the map itself and we started thinking okay well there s something in this here so we talked about we talked about platforms as literally being like the etymology plateaus you know they are raised up from everything else that is the ground or is the flow or is the internet or whateverelse and this started of course with the page rank system you know webs web sites had to be seen so there was the idea of a search engine that would rank or page rank from from brynn and page and brings page rank is the is basically the the originalstep or edge if you like that later becomes the edge rank that we find in a lot of these platforms so we re drawing a conclusion at this point that the that the platform the edge of this platform this edge less edge in a way is defined by the user and but defined by the multiple users as well because the the social media application is only as strong as the number of followers as you know as was mentioned before the idea of gavin parlor and all of these these apps they have their followersagain subscribing to the ideology of platform ism but that communal edge is the is determined by the algorithm of affinity and weight and decay so the number of people that you have around you at any given time and the weight which is the importanceof your post the idea that it is original content or it s you know it s better than a just a repost or a like and then the decay that it is how it s like losing visibility over time so the idea this will encourage users to keep posting so there s a continuous stream all of these activities together are forming you know the edge of your own profile this edge rank for yourself as a user and collectively within the platform but then the edge of that platform if it is your own activity and you re living that and posting it it keeps pushing beyond its as you know and he just said is it is an endless edge so i talked a little bit about derek darren here which karen doesn t want me to mention but let s say that i m i m leaning on their dogs notion of a korea so this border beyond which we can t pass so this so so the platform represents in a way i a map of our tour territory in which we step into because we feel we sense an existential threat like joey we move into it and it s and and moving towards that edge is impossible it s an appropriate and angeles edge because it represents a kind of civic tokyo kind of representation of ourselves so i ll read otherwise we ll never end this karen so users upload their life content to social media reconstructing their world they take on a digital persona and step into the map social media provides the app profiles sorry social media profiles or the app replace the territory and there are users who find comfort in the template driven surface of the plateau like joey and others who are uncomfortable and resist the urge like chandler not end on chandler s words when joe he steps into the map chandler s kind of horrified by this and he looks on and says if you see a little version of me in there kill it that s as good a place to end last chance well i think the conclusion though it s yet definitely about platform ism but the conclusion that we draw it in the paper that unfortunately we didn t upload in time is that what what writing can occur when you re writing with the awareness of the processes of the edge that will allow your work to be seen in the in a particular way and it creates your audience for you it s not it s not a democratizing space in any in any way your audience is filtered by this edge rank so what writing can occur when you write with the awareness of the processes of the edge knowing that the the activity is the data that you re transactingtransacting this is the exchange that you sign off on on the terms of service when you become a user and you enact the platform ism and then knowing that you have zero space to reprogram your communication spaces so that s i guess the question is how can we write in against the platform yeah that was it i think we we thought five minutes wasn t very much we just thought would outlive thank you thank you karen thank you and i actually think it was the perfect concluding presentation for the panel because i feel there is there is there s the whole opposition or balance to be found between platforms and online platforms and mobile platforms as enabling and as tools for resistance to marginalization and democracy and so on which is a valid approach but equally valid is thequestion of who controls platform platforms who controls their design who decides what we see who sees ourthe products of our creative work and beers our voice so i think that tension is something that might be interesting to discuss as well a little bit from the point of view of all of the presentations or are in the context of all of the topics coveredhere so if people have questions or comments please add a plus or q to the chat window and i will distributescott sport for questions here i think there s one already here from carlotta is carlos oh here i am but i didn t have a question okay there was okay that was another comment okay there s two questions waiting so we ll start with search perhaps and then i m gonna give you so i happen to see certain question person then we ll move on to a knife that s okay read my question into the chat ori can hear you just got to question for two questions for you susie there is a french never trilogies phosphorus literature and she defines empathy and efficient as the we say it in french because i know you can speak french the disease obviously divinia on the penetration model so for her an interactive narrative again as below me my love would be more based on identification than an empathy so would you agree with that this is my first question and i ve got the second question i think it s interesting to notice that the inspiration of bernie my love originally in french was a real what s up thread published by limo the the newspaper but the website reminded site it was called the diary of immigrant and then it was transformed in a in efficient for smartphone miss patricia and bernie my love place on notifications by a fictional character sent to the reader and to this you know this frontier blood between the fictional time and reduce real time so do you think that the smartphone device reinforces accelerates the blurring of the fiction that s useful at frontier distinction yes thank you so much so those are two really great questions and to address the first question this idea of empathy as a hindered or block desire to help the character i think that s really pertinent to bury me my love and for me there is a point which also made me think of some years presentation in which the female writers referred to catharsis and emancipation because there s a point invariably my love in which nor admits that she is tired of the abuse that she s been suffering and this conscioussomething really jarring to both the user and to magic because the way in which she depicts her experience is always extremely jokey it s almost as if she s partaking in this mischievous adventure and there is a point in which that sort of crack inthe in the perfect carving of the narrative as something liberating leads the user and magic to question that whole depiction so there is an element in which that flips the whole experience and it shows precisely that blockage to empathy the fact thatwhat we ve been consuming is produced specifically for our consumption and not as a realistic depiction of personal experience so i think that experience of empathy as a frustrated and impossible identification is probably and engendered by that onesort of pivotal point so i think that s quite interesting and the second question let me just have a little look oh no i ve lost it it was real what do you think the smartphone device reinforces the blurring of the fiction restaurant at frontier absolutely because when you enable these push notifications on your phone the message that appears will sometimesit doesn t have any sort of meta bottom banner that shows that it s from the app it doesn t sort of say bury me my love content designated sort of distinction from your reality so you re getting messages that say things like i m stuck on the croatianborder or i made it or my phone might die soon and they re popping in a note and entwined with the logic of your own sort of phone messages so you re getting whatsapp messages saying things like bring milk and bread from the shop and sort of messagessaying what am i going to do but the violence that the serbian border so i think that s really effective and i think that blurring is really necessary to the generation of an empathy that can only go so far because of precisely that blocked ability toidentify and experience so to really interesting questions thank you so much and i m looking forward to reading your work on very much thanks very much so i think connects its honor stephanie and david unless i ve missed somebody and if i have give me give me a shout so anna you have a question um thank you very much for all your presentations and also think of search for your question because actually my question is also to susie and it sort of develops along similar line and it also stands from my analysis of interactive story cold migration trail night and your presentation actually the questions made me think about one particular aspect because you don t know rightcan be such a centralizing and unit sizing tool when it comes to the fiction of dramatic and tragic developments right um my question would be do you see any chance or any role or significance significance for the gaps in the narrative because my impression is when i analyze migration trail a couple of years ago it was published in the hater is that and a current who happens to be editing so anyway we ll make analyze this interactive story i sort of wasn t aware of it then and i m aware of the stack now that i m you know these days when we have platforms and when basically most of our experience is so centralized so you know packed and ready to consume right by the others we might be needs different approaches we may be need are the narrative that is open to gaps discontinuitiesfrictions you know in order to present this extremely traumatic experiences because migration plan trailers also based on the real events of the migration crisis in europe in but what it offered it unfolded on over the course of days so you could unlock the next chapter only the next day after you finished the previous one so what is did was that you were sort of left um you know in in the vacuum you know in in the vacuum when you finish the reading the chapter and then you didn t know what happens to to the protagonist and then there were also some some i think intentionally inserted gaps that came from on the performances of the bathroomshe used like it didn t load you know seamlessly you had to wait until it loads and you didn t know you know this this kind of gaps so i m so sorry for taking up so much space but actually it s because your your presentation was so so inspiring so so that would be my question do you see any any chance in the potential or any examples of such gaps discontinuities that would actually be you know for me that would be the potential to empathetic storylines yeah thanks that s really great and i absolutely think that so links in a little bit to what we were saying with surge i think that pivotal moment in which we realized that what nor is relaying isn t actually veryfrank a depiction of her experience it s more something that kind of exposes that consideration and i think that s something that begs another question as well as the self censorship of migrant narrative for the sake of the public not suffering unrest presentable i think that s really crucial so i think that as well the delays that we experienced and very mean my love and the fact that actually it has different endings and but sometimes it s just a cut off in the communication and it snot it s obviously not ghosting but it s the equivalent it s you know the fact that communication just ceases to unfold in a way that the user at the point that this happens has gotten used to exchanging and there s a kind of always a temporary reassurancein what little can be communicated so i do think that unknown that the non narrative gestures to is much more important and so the narrative itself serves this kind of adjacent function whereby it s always gesturing to the non representative of whatit s its function is very important in doing so so that sort of incompleteness is is what feeds our awareness of what needs to be understood if that answers thanks great thanks for the question and thanks to susan for the answer stephanie has had her hand up would i think there s a question about posting a link to the paper but stephanie would you like to ask further question yeah no i was i wanted to know about if we could ever lincoln and we have gotten the link and i think now we ve gotten another differently about sorry much and david has a question here for all panelists today would you like me to ask your question or you know that why not called stand and stand out of our lives where he kind of said we should we need to assert ourselves upon like these social media platforms you know we actually needed as a public you can t expect the public to develop media theory as a kind of general policy and we need to actually set some certain things upon them and i m wondering you know it was kind of geared towards any presentation but also i suppose samuels you know that the public can have any control over these social media or the dissemination platforms or do you think that time has passed that s a rather broad question i realize is your question addressed to everybody should we just let everybody have my own and i know that sorry i was going to ask somebody would like to startis just he was the first to present if it s a question for everybody orsomething oh yeah yeah i think that if you talk about social media platforms and under control over what people post i think it s very important especially to mind context because i was just reading the previous execute whether people from draft the who are also coincidentally from india they were they were presenting about their explorations in in electronic literature now they used google sheets as a place to showcase their projects to give links to other projects the way they have usedgoogle sheets google sheets it s just say it as a place where you can type where you can do stuff but the way they have used google sheets it seems like they ve used like a platform itself where it looks like a space where you can navigate i certainly did not think that you can use google sheets like this that is number one and number two about instagram when instagram came out mainly it was because of people sharing pictures on it but now i see people creating media to instagram withdreams etc etc so every mode every moment of every media can be used in ways that we like but the question once again depends on that for me at least it depends on the differences as well because i see people meeting on twitch and discussing academicactivities on twitch but that can be possible in our particular social cultural context where that is possible that can be possible in the context where there is the technical importance but not in india in india for discussions in whatever mannerpersonal professional we still have to bank on something like whatsapp therefore the blur the line between the public and the private is not there so i think the interrogation should be on the performances the infrastructure and most importantly the digital divide which i believe is extremely important yeah thank you for the question thank you very much summit susie would you like to respond to the question sure um i ll just comment really quickly on a kind of knee jerk reaction to that thought and one of the questions posed was can the public have any control over social media platforms and i think theroot of a lot of the issues we have with public engagement with social media platforms is that precisely they think they are being given controlled by these platforms and so i think that you know that has such a radical overhaul calling to be done that i m not sure that awareness is for many even blunted and as you say that i m the public want to sort of independently developed media theory so that self reflectiveability to step back and analyze what s happening as a kind of mechanism of control and is not sort of planted yet for more so i think at the risk of sounding a little bit pessimistic i think that idea of the public gaining control needs to be precededby an awareness that control is a factor that is impinging upon social media use in the first place and i ll stop there becausejulian any thoughts i don t know okay yeah lots of thoughts but a little bit a little bit muddy but i thought first of i was thinking of platform cooperative ism but that s sort of sharing economy stuff but you know as terms of an effort to kind of reclaim the platform or something like it and then i was also thinking of put it in the chat that caroline busters article it was quite nice earlier this year about the counterculture and kind of you know dark forest sort of you know a proliferation of new kinds of platforms and new forms of counterculture off the kindof mainstream platforms i don t know something something something like thanks thanks for the link as well right so yeah andy who inspired this question how would you like to thank you julian for that link i know what i m reading tomorrow morning so um i think it s a question of controlling what do we mean writing the code we mean writing that algorithm that measures every action and behavior whether conscious or otherwise the the it s not that it s too late if there was never any control where where you know we re offered to be users but we re being used you know that that there would have to be i don t know i can imagine the possibility of some sort of i don t know that they can never be any control in my opinion karen i think the control can be perhaps in in the weight i m thinking of the tick tock users who will get together and and promised to be at trump s rally and completely sort of tilted that off balance and and so i think they can be control but not in thevisual sense like i think as you know we re designers so we often struggle with working on on all of these platforms and we had a sort of a thriving internet art publication until the arrival of these platforms that the kind of just vacuumed up justhoovered up our audience and took them on to the mobile devices and flash wouldn t run on them and nothing was was compatible anymore and the audience didn t seem to care they weren t looking outwards they were looking inwards so we needed to get past i think that whole sort of flurry of the emergence of the selfie and and and all of this sort of narcissistic posting your breakfast and and and all of those sort of we needed to get all of those urges out as as the general massor the mass population could suddenly publish and be seen on a screen and on a device and they were looking at themselves and i think this is the risk of writing in the platform is that you get tangled up in this sort of narcissistic identity requestand sometimes you get so distracted you forget why you were there in the first place sometimes you get so distracted you forget why you were there in the first place but i think yes you can because in the long run all of the activity of the social media platform is the edge and that age is feeding back the data to you know as oil you know as the supply to the machinery to the machinery to the you know to the iphones we probably do have some say we don t reallyknow it but it s not a loud voice but we have you know with our wallets and and with our being followers and being active on the social media platforms we do have a certain amount of agency but it s not precisely that the design that we would imagine or that we had the freedom to have when when the internet and php and all that sort of stuff was and flash was was the dominant hegemony but i thinki think it s shaking now i think you know this mass acceleration of everybody going on to the platforms has widened you know the the opportunities and the performances in in digital space so i am optimistic i m not quite sure if the route to get there i disagree completely we sorry we we do all need to code we need to you know follow mike marinas advice and and everyone else here in the room that code is and i you know obviously plug away until we can we can break whatever we can put something else and it s maybe writing to the edges is called i presume it is yeah thank you very much and encourage and any questions that i have missed give me a shout know if i have because i have a question so one thing that i started thinking about that has to do with writing and language and access but in a slightly different way in which they ve been introduced his language translation and the hegemony of english and how this question of agency and kind of resistance to modularization might relate to the language that people use a want to use or understand or have access to and i suppose this is a question to anyone in the panel something that i was thinking of the indian context in particular but then of course french language and so on that susie susie has written about friendship like french literature even though it wasn t the topic today but it is relevant to social media as well as me would you like to comment on the question of language and use of online platforms for demanding yeah absolutely i would love to comment on that because that is something which has been very integral to my experience growing up specially because i m from india it is an ex colony of britain britain and and the colonial hangover is something that is palatable usable in daily lives now what you were saying about the hegemony of language this can be seen in two ways and this is this is the debate that i have with natives of my place all the time that there are one strand of people who think that we need to go back to our own languages whatever that means and use that for vacationfor academics and all sorts of stuff but taking my language into consideration i am a native english speaker bengali that is it s not a language which can accommodate a lot of technical technology or whatever whatever there are a lot of difficulty when you come across it was i was recently asked you to serve as a social media translator for something that s coming up and i m supposed to writings in bengali over there but my question here my problem here is to how do i get across do i write some words in bengali and some words in english now that is one way to look at it whether you use your own language or whether you do not and there are some other people who think that quote unquote some language which is from the colonizer that language is no longer a part of the colonizer ina very caliban tempests sense of the term it is your language now and whether you want to speak back course or whatever you want to do it s your language now i m more belonging to the lighter side of the spectrum but when i see people use language on social media they use it in two ways people who are proficient in english we use english and people who want to use bangla the us bangla but there are alsoalso people who know both but they prefer to use bangla just because they want to show what their identity is where they come from and what their identity is so i think it s a matter of personal politics of what do people started for you have very honest and i have tried to pinpoint it to a general consensus but i have failed thank you very much samia and there s there was a question coming from certain but certain has decided that he has he has sort of been no yes thank you yes thank you all for your presentation and i just want to thank again somehow for his precious suggestions and i may ask you if you may explain a little more if you want your next goals for the electronic literature in india thank you oh thank you thank you so much for the question about that nice to see you after like two or three days with with you so for me electronic literature well a very important part of electronic register for me is to explore different technical challenges i mean using vr ar it s very attractive very nice and it it can be used in different other ways also what should we be belonging to a space whichis still very print dominated as as people as andy and i were talking about i m sorry if i can get your name properly so another important part of me is to propagate the notion of web based literacy by the use of electronic literature which is something that i have been saying for a long time that ever since we grow we have been growing up we have been taught toread and write on paper but now most of the reading and writing i won t say most but a major chunk of reading and writing happened long line what we haven t been trained to do so online and so what i experience from people of my generation and being from other generation one not acquainted with the online the electronic or the web or whatever you want to call it there is this print anxietythat comes into into the picture which is extremely extremely visible that people are anxious about using the internet about scared about pop ups or something like that and they always want to use someone s else s assistance so i personally would think of using electronic digital because it challenges your perception of the media where it is being written when when you click on it whether you scroll through it whether you drag point drop do whatever you want the images and then cc text then click on a hyperlink go to a different web page see something and come back not anything extraordinary justthe rudimentary it challenges your perception on how you do read things how you perceive things on the web and i believe that it has a very important pedagogical purpose that can be solved in this is as basic as the higher education classroom so yeah that s all that s what something that i would like to explore in the indian context the pedagogical possibility thank you thank you so much which is a few minutes left and i think we let certain ask his his question sorry i hope i didn t miss miss you too fast is this it was your own or comment that actually you might be okay but we have time for it it s okay brother it s a continuation of these comments that have come up there and the discussion we ve had in the chat of you know platformsas compared to paper or print or something like that and and and i m totally agreeing to i think it was susie who pointed out that that of course platforms have this kind of algorithmic way of conforming to whatever you re doing and also of of of limiting what you can do also through data tracking and feedback etc though i still also think and that was where i think karen and pointed in that direction that that this period over the last year where we ve been so emerged in platforms we are we at this point where we might have started to to learn to read them in different ways that we we learned learn that the the data that tracks us is not necessarily as i know okay it s going great or the green always going to speak about thatlater today that that we are not our data data is also just a language and and and i think the really interesting aspects here is is also of the papers that was presented here is whether we have also different you both kind of use practices but also reading practices within different communities and of course something like manifestos is is a way of challenging also platforms right so so perhaps it s not really a question but a comment perhaps it s not really a question but a comment but i think you know so this yeah this moment of readings i think is really interesting thank you very much and if it s a comment is a fine concluding comment i think if we have exactly one minute so if somebody has a very short answer we have time for that but if everybody s happy with things as they are i think we can we can accept that that was a wonderful concluding comment for the panel i think i think we are here okay in terms of questions especiallywhen you have a question i have to present how can you presenting okay
