motivating struggling readers to mentally show up with wonder stories elliott hedman mpath denver usa hedman media mit edu abstract in the united states a student in the th percentile reads books for minutes per day while a student in the th percentile reads minutes per day cunningham stanovich for the last four years with children from title schools and the boys girls club we researched how to create digital texts that better cognitively engage struggling readers using psychophysiological sensors eye tracking and co creation this research led to the creation of wonder stories wonder stories texts motivate students to critically think by immersing students in frequent story based questions as a response to children s low motivations during covid we added a social competition to wonder stories answering questions correctly gave points in a trivia like game when struggling readers were given wonder stories students mentally showed up their participation increased readers were more cognitively engaged with the material and students were critically thinking about the text more often this study suggests that interactive question based reading shows great promise to increasing children s participation and engagement in middle grade reading i challenge it requires extensive practice to become skilled at an activity allington putting struggling readers at a disadvantage with their lack of reading hours according to the national reading panel literally hundreds of correlational studies find that the best readers read the most and the poor readers read the least these correlational studies suggest that the more children read the better their fluency vocabulary and comprehension p correspondingly another strong predictor of reading scores is a child s engagement with reading reading engagement is more influential than gender income or ethnicity cox guthrie the boys girls club of metro denver faced the challenge that many of their students were not reading at all when they came back to the club in the middle of covid elo conference and festival platform post pandemic may after more than six months of not being in school the students were actively resisting reading activities a defining showing up when a student shows up to reading they have a will to learn covington students are excited and curious to start reading the student is open to difficult challenges a student who shows up cognitively engages with the task set before them a student who does not show up chooses not to participate if given the option when asked to do a task they will actively resist do nothing or participate minimally in our reading setting participating minimally often meant skipping texts and answering questions without thinking b students were not mentally showing up to read for the last four years dr elliott hedman has been a researcher in residence at the boys girls club of metro denver there of students are african american and of students are hispanic omni institute most of these students attend title schools and are one to two grade levels below reading with covid the denver public schools closed down but the boys girls club was considered essential and opened in august in addition to the research dr hedman was doing he was invited to be the new literacy teacher for the opened club while many teachers were struggling to motivate kids to physically show up to zoom meetings the boys girls club had a different problem students were not mentally showing up in the classroom reading sucks those were the first words second grade student emanuel told dr hedman as he came back to the vickers boys girls club when dr hedman pulled up the first reading assignment third grade student adonis actively pushed against participation he told the class he did not want to read others echoed adonis s attitude the social worker came in to help settle things down on that same day dr hedman worked with the fifth and sixth grade students when he told the students they denver and title schools exploring how to make digital reading a more engaging experience for this year with reduced class sizes due to covid we worked with a smaller set of students we asked participating students to read digital prototypes we observed children s behaviors with both screen recording and digital eye tracking tobii technology ab sweden in some cases before covid we asked readers to wear psychophysiological sensors to monitor their emotional engagement see hedman after each session we interviewed children about their reading experience and how the experience could be improved we used a design based research method to improve students motivation cobb et al based on student feedback we would make improvements to the reading app and show students the updated version the following week through the four years this reading prototype has been iterated on over times and we are still iterating on it with covid our research methodology was modified since dr hedman was teaching reading to the boys girls club interviews were done in class and observations were made live iterations were still done to the product but changes were made primarily to help children better show up to their reading lessons a description of intervention below is a description of the most recent reading intervention we used during most of covid wonder stories are short stories that are approximately words in length each page has one to three sentences stories are presented as mysteries with big problems the major difference between typical stories and wonder stories is that there are many questions interspersed throughout the text typically around seven questions in a word story these questions are critical to the plot and require deduction and inferential thinking for example dr llama can t see anything because she is _______ too far away or to help glomper dr llama brings back _______ binoculars were going to read their eyes drifted back to their cell phones and computer games ignoring him only one fifth grade student read with him that first day back while students were physically back in the boys girls club they were not ready to engage with reading and actively resisted reading any text c students were removed from a culture of daily reading many students had likely not read a book all year they may not have books at home luo et al and spent less than minute per day reading cunningham stanovich d book donatitions did not change the reading culture while at the club dr hedman brought over of his own middle grade books with popular titles such as diary of a wimpy kid and dog man throughout the course of the year none of those books were read all stayed in the storage bin the boys girls club also received a large donation of hundreds of new books with diverse main characters during covid those books sat on the pool table unread as well the high school students received a collection of the first book in the harry potter series which never left the plastic wrapping access to physical books by itself did not solve the showing up problem as reading was not motivating e addressing the showing up problem while there is literature on the importance of motivation research on how to motivate students in reading is still lacking guthrie providing texts students are interested in cox guthrie and providing students choice worthy mckool are two main strategies for engaging readers top digital reading tools today emphasize the abundance of literature students can choose from epic s front page announces it has books myon has with this many books students are given an abundance of choice and books within their interests yet like harry potter in plastic wrap for many students having access to books of interest is not enough to motivate them to show up and become engaged readers our research and co creation went beyond choice and topic how could we redesign the actual experience of reading to motivate children in the last six months we worked with students most of them behind in reading not wanting to show up this lack of motivation was likely due in part to students not having exposure to physical book reading for more than six months when schools once again open in person we believe other teachers will experience our same challenge of students not wanting to show up to reading ii methods over the last four years we have conducted research with over kids at the boys girls club of metro fig example of wonder story format elo conference and festival platform post pandemic may partway through our research during covid we b increased academic engagement noticed that some children were resistant to reading even with interactive text we created new prototypes to add in social motivators to wonder stories for our early prototypes we integrated wonder stories with kahoot in kahoot when children answer questions correctly they receive points and are ranked against one another we tied kahoot points to each question as children read you can download and view our wonder stories app at www wonderstories app you can see an example of the kahoot and wonder story prototype here https create kahoot it share glomper goes to the dentist c a d becb a e c you can access all of our kahoot prototypes by looking for the username wonderstory in kahoot throughout the year students read different wonder stories kindergarten to third grade students read as a group taking turns reading off of the projector the fourth grade students alternated reading as a group and individually and the sixth and seventh graders read individually reading material was at a second to fourth grade reading level depending on the homeroom teacher some classes offered a prize for the first and second place students the fifth and sixth grade students performance was tied to classcraft rewards iii results a increased academic participation within three weeks all students were reading wonder stories daily without protest except for two which we will discuss later some students began asking the teacher in the hallway when are we going to play wonder stories again other students asked to read another story after the minute reading period was over students would already be logged into kahoot ready to play before dr hedman arrived at the classroom on three separate occasions parents came to pick up students and the students asked their parents to wait so they could finish wonder stories wonder stories worked particularly well for children who struggled with reading in school as the fifth grade student davies said in class i don t know what it is but normally during school i just drift off but with wonder stories it is really easy for me to pay attention with wonder stories we started with students who hated reading and created a way to encourage students to mentally show up and participate elo conference and festival platform post pandemic may in addition to observing children participating we observed an increased level of academic engagement as well typically during reading questions observed students do not put effort into their tasks during the accelerated reading star test that students are required to take each semester we observed most students randomly selecting answers and skipping reading the test had no meaning for them and they did not show up the competition feature added importance to each question in wonder stories consequentially students cared about comprehension and answering correctly students asked the teacher or one another for hints on questions when students answered questions correctly there was often a verbal celebration or a fist pump sometimes students would restart the reading assignment once they answered a few questions wrong one particularly struggling fifth grade student kaseem asked if he could read with the teacher or the top student to make sure he got every question right when a correct answer felt wrong students would point it out and argue with the teacher why they felt it was correct there is no way you can put a costume on a fish in addition wonder stories made it easier to help students dr hedman would tell struggling students let me read with you i want to make sure you get the next question right similarly some struggling readers were in the habit of skipping past all of the text a behavior we have observed many times with eye tracking we were able to tell these fast readers if you skip past the text it is going to be really hard to get the question right making the conversation more positive and helpful students not only participated in reading but were cognitively engaged with the texts they were reading working hard to comprehend the text c increased comprehension and critical thinking skills the goal of teaching reading is not only to help children with phonics and fluency but build their higher level skill of comprehension as well oakhill cain wonder stories includes a comprehension question about every words children are asked to make a model of what they read and make an inference based off of that model this inference making is regarded as a high level skill kintsch that often is not developed until third grade paris lindauer paris lindauer cox but with wonder stories inferential questions are part of the process for all grades the ability to make inferences is a strong predictor of overall reading comprehension across multiple studies cain oakhill cain oakhill elbro cain oakhill lemmon the kindergarten to third grade students often scored as well or better on the comprehension questions than their older peers suggesting that young children were able to work on higher level comprehension skills within the wonder stories setting table students comprehension scores on select stories fig skin conductance of student reading wonder stories with inquiry based reading children across grades were applying critical thinking skills and showing high levels of comprehension d questions motivate during our early prototypes and testing children often drifted off during the reading sessions however when questions occurred readers would become much more engaged and attentive as an example here is the psychophysiological data of a third grade english language learner at the boys girls club reading doctor dolittle reading wonder stories there is a substantial increase in the number of skin conductance spikes the student answered every comprehension question correctly and reported that reading the story was almost as fun as math in all of our research we noticed a similar trend that interactive questions were a strong foundation for engagement and attention here is a zoomed in skin conductance of another reader reading a digital text with questions interspersed fig skin conductance of a third grade reader the above graph shows the student s skin conductance a marker of psychophysiological arousal when the graph spikes up like at the beginning those are moments where the student is likely engaging when there are no spikes in skin conductance these are moments where the reader is likely disengaging from the text in this example the student drifted off while reading doctor dolittle for less than eight minutes when the researchers ended the session they noted a big glob of drool on the front page during this same testing session the student read a wonder story elo conference and festival platform post pandemic may fig skin conductance increases with questions notice how reading itself fails to engage the reader but the question afterward increases his engagement substantially on its own with our eye tracking glasses we noticed a similar trend children would skip past the reading consistently speeding to the question but would then read the question multiple times e social competition enhances readers motivation while questions were a strong motivator in our one on one tests questions alone were typically not enough to motivate the class after trying a few different modifications children s reading motivations substantially increased when we combined kahoot and wonder stories when the social competition was added to the questions students cared much more about answering correctly an important factor to engagement hedman zanchi hedman it was only after kahoot was integrated with wonder stories that we started to see the participation behaviors of asking to play more and asking for help previous research suggests that social connections can play an important role in motivation see cooc kim barron olivera strauss feeling like they lost we may be able to add better game mechanics in the future to address this like double points another benefit of shorter stories is that we are able to read more of them we now typically read two to three stories in a minute session the new stories and restarted competition refresh students attention span additionally having multiple stories gives more students a chance to win we believe this increase in motivation is in part due to where children are developmentally in terms of defining success students need support and belief in their competence to gain motivation ryan and deci starting as early as second grade children begin defining their skill level in comparison to others ruble et al social comparison theory posits it is difficult to see oneself as good at reading without comparing oneself to another person festinger as an example malachi a second grade student was one of our most reluctant readers putting up strong resistance each day we taught he refused to play kahoot or wonder stories at first a few times he did agree to play and in one of those times he scored in the top three at the end he exclaimed i got in the top three this pride generated enthusiasm and confidence for future rounds he started asking if he could read pages so much so that we now are working with him on giving other children a chance to read out loud after his first success malachi is now willing to read wonder stories with us a similar story occurred with the fourth grade student athena who often scored last in the kahoot game one day the teacher asked to read together with athena and helped her think through each question athena earned second that day and was more enthusiastic to read the following days adding a social competition to comprehension questions is a strong way to make correctly answering questions important and build reader confidence f keeping story length short sustains motivation most of the wonder stories we read are to words designed to be read in less than minutes originally we started with longer stories that were about words and took or more minutes to read for many of the readers these long stories took too long partway through these long stories children would start fidgeting talking with each other or stop participating the kindergarten student james would consistently tell us after about words i m going to stop reading now we started providing texts shorter than words and students were able to sustain attention readers stopped asking how many more pages no student has complained about the stories being too short social competition also created a problem for longer stories sometimes students would answer two to three questions wrong and know they were not going to win in a short story by the time they realize that they only have one or two questions left to finish up in the long stories they may have to endure or more minutes of reading already elo conference and festival platform post pandemic may iv limitations a how can we better use social competition to enhance motivation at the beginning of this study social competition was not something we seriously considered but it became increasingly important for improving motivation we were limited by the scope of what kahoot could do and believe that there are many more ways of bringing competition into reading while many of the students especially the boys were motivated by competing with their peers others were intimidated by the social competition aspect olivia a proficient first grade reader often asked not to play one time she hid behind a plant so the teacher would not call on her to play for olivia we believe she needed a way to contribute without being judged kaseem in fifth grade struggled with failure as soon as he answered a problem wrong he would quit sometimes even acting out to the point the social worker would need to intervene one day kaseem partnered with asha the top performing reader the partnership worked well as kaseem was able to answer all of the problems right with asha s help social competition is not always better for all students future research should look into how social competition can better celebrate struggling students how can competition be across groups rather than within groups to better encourage collaboration how can students stay engaged after getting a problem wrong what other interventions work for children who do not like social competition b external factors and teachers still matter with covid things were often in flux at the boys girls club multiple times classes would have a new homeroom teacher on new teacher days students would often push boundaries more taking out their cell phones or intentionally skipping through readings for the fifth and sixth grade classes students were much more likely to read and participate when prizes were incorporated with classcraft having clear rewards and structures tied to getting in the top had a strong effect future studies should take into consideration the external factors in reading that help increase student participation while interactive reading increases participation and engagement classroom structure and management still play an important role c how can interactive reading enhance longer texts a key strategy of our intervention was limiting reading to five to minute short stories as kids progress they will be expected to engage with reading for much longer periods how can questions and social competition engage students for longer periods of time how can interactive reading work for a chapter book v conclusion co creating with over students across four years we set out to redesign books to help readers show up to reading with psychophysiological sensors eye tracking and ethnographic methods we created wonder stories wonder stories provided frequent story based questions added social competition and provided short stories for many students who were not normally motivated to read wonder stories did motivate them to show up to reading and cognitively engage interactive question based reading shows great promise to increase children s
