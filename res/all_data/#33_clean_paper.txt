digital narrative and temporality serge bouchardon and erika fülöp introduction we sometimes hear it said that our relationship with time has been altered in companies and administrations the adoption of new management strategies means that employees feel themselves subjected to ever increasing urgency and stress the fomo syndrome the anxiety generated by our fear of missing out on something in a world in which we are exposed to a constant flow of information and access to other people s narratives or at least to their stories is a phenomenon inherently linked to the digital environment the covid crisis has no doubt accentuated this tendency with its injunction to stay increasingly connected particularly to social media and video conferencing platforms and to immediately respond to digital notifications and sollicitations on a basis according to paul ricoeur narrative attains its full meaning when it becomes a condition of temporal existence ricoeur from this perspective narrative is our principal tool for situating ourselves in time and for experiencing time within ourselves moreover the digital may be characterized as a tool for the phenomenal deconstruction of temporality bachimont this is reflected in its two main tendencies that of real time calculation conveying the impression of immediacy and that of universality of access conveying the impression of availability the digital thanks to its availability and its immediacy thus leads to a constant state of presence without any trace of the passage of time bachimont what happens then when the digital and narrative come together when digital technology and narrative discourse between which obvious tension exists are combined what happens when we exploit the particularities of programmable media to use the term coined by john cayley which for bruno bachimont are essentially detemporalizing to tell a story which we traditionally consider as being structured by an internal temporality and linked to an external temporality from such a perspective the term digital narrative would appear almost oxymoronic digital narratives do nevertheless exist and are proliferating in multiple forms and thanks to varied approaches what kind of temporal experiences are constructed by these new forms of digital narrative and how are they constructed reciprocally what new narrative forms or even new concepts of narrative do these new temporal experiences provided by digital technology offer to time becomes human to the extent that it is articulated through a narrative mode and narrative attains its full meaning when it becomes a condition of temporal existence ricoeur le temps devient temps humain dans la mesure où il est articulé de manière narrative en retour le récit est significatif dans la mesure où il dessine les traits de l expérience temporelle us the challenges lie in the manner in which narratives revisited for and by digital tools and the digital environment can on one hand stand up to the deconstruction of time provoked by the said tools and environment and on the other hand make us reflect on our relationship with time and on the place of narrative as a discursive mode in our culture and our ways of interpreting the world in this article we will focus on three very different types of digital stories in order to analyse the diverging potentialities of the relationship between the digital temporality and narrative we will study two artistic creations on the one hand and the widely used social media feature of stories on the other we will first examine a fictional work written for the smartphone downloadable from an app store which is based on notifications i e in which a fictional character regularly sends notifications to the user this type of narrative plays on notions of temporality with the intrusion of the reader s real time we will also study a narrative based on a real time data flow the constraints imposed on the narrative by this type of apparatus imply that the causality of events is replaced by the sequentiality of real events yet this technical specificity the linking of the narrative to a real time data flow can mean that life s contingencies enter into the narrative and result in a pure time experience chambefort finally with a change of field and direction we will examine the phenomenon of the stories made possible notably by platforms such as instagram and facebook which allow users to display a short video clip an animated or static picture a text or even a mini survey for a default duration of twenty four hours which in turn is temporalized and presented to users with an associated duration of fifteen seconds after which the feature automatically displays the next story available in the user s newsfeed these three examples each explore the notion of temporality and the use of time in the digital narrative from a different angle first the interaction between the real time of the reader and his her reading with narrative time and so with the fictional work then that of the diegetic time determined by the data flow which thus becomes the temporal axis of the work in question and finally the temporality imposed by the story features on various platforms presented as a constitutive aspect of the story and which the content provided by the user adopts and integrates the digital time and narrative if the digital medium is principally a medium for detemporalization as established by bruno bachimont bachimont it nonetheless makes if possible to perform time it enables time to be acted out or to play a role in a fictional work thanks to the interactive dimension it offers to the user if we are to compare the different ways of staging time depending on the medium we could claim that the audiovisual media which are time based media are by definition very prescriptive the length of a film coincides with the viewer s stream of consciousness stiegler even enterre moi mon amour bury me my love the pixel hunt and arte france https enterremoimonamour arte tv lucette gare de clichy françoise chambefort http fchambef fr lucette if media for individual use allow for interruptions rewinding fast forwarding or acceleration modifying the original temporality inscribed in a fictional work the printed text is inversely not very prescriptive the reader acts out his her own reading time between interruptions and cursive reading the digital in its capacity as a metamedium manovich is capable of reproducing the characteristics of all previous types of media without their materiality and can act both ways it can also offer other dimensions thanks to its inherent interactivity and the fact that it is connected to a network and external resources allows it to draw on and manipulate their temporality a digital narrative can also stage the user s time on a local level as well as delegating to them or to a third party who is also a member of the network the instigation or even the execution of temporal actions roberto simanowski considers that from the temporal point of view the relationship of digital literature to digitized literature is analogous to that of the film to photography this comparison would seem to hold only partially in that digital narratives play on the whole range of possibilities from the initiation of the process as when viewing a film to control by the reader when reading a book of the temporality of reading or viewing an important notion should be emphasized here that of performance jerome fletcher proposes that performance considered in its relation to performativity should be taken in its broadest sense in the field of digital literature thus performance could articulate various dimensions of digital texts while continuing the investigation of live performance we will be seeking to broaden the scope to include interactivity the performative gesture of the hand and fingers digital text on the interface the performativity of language itself on the screen social performance or how digital texts perform us the performance of codes and scripting and the performance of the machine itself i e what does an engineer mean when s he talks about performance what is particularly interesting here in the notion of performance is the idea that a process is underway that is to say we are dealing with an event rather than with an object this is what ian bogost refers to as procedural representation procedural representation explains processes with other processes procedural representation is a form of symbolic expression that uses process rather than language procedural representation itself requires inscription in a medium that actually enacts processes rather than merely describe them procedural representation is significantly different from textual visual and plastic representation even though other inscription techniques may be partly or wholly driven by a desire to represent human or material processes only procedural systems like computer software actually represent process with process this is where the particular power of procedural authorship lies in its native ability to depict processes bogost fletcher j in his introductory paper for the seminar digital textuality with in performance may at the university of falmouth gb the digital narrative insofar as it constitutes an event and process performed by the machine and by the reader may re introduce temporality a temporality that intertwines the activity of the computer with that of the reader player user this inter active manner of living a temporal experience must be distinguished here from the experience of time constructed by all narratives according to ricoeur we have on one hand the temporal experience brought into existence and formulated through narrative by its very essence according to its traditional classification as discourse establishing a chronology and causality and on the other hand the temporal experience performed by the reader user based on a process taking place on a timescale with a varying degree of mani pul ability within the frame and the limits imposed by the software although in digital narratives the writing reading medium has a tendency towards spatialization the way in which the medium not only performs time but also transforms its manifestations on the screen and the reading process into a performance also tends towards temporalization and offers a temporal experience as such this type of production can also be interpreted as a questioning of temporality to what extent do the most recent forms of digital narrative introduce and or incarnate a new relationship with time narrative games for the smartphone smartfictions built around notifications according to bruno bachimont a narrative may be seen as a causal articulation of agents within a flow of events conceived as what happens what happens to me what happens to us bachimont the incoherence of the flow is reconstructed in a coherent manner by the narrative which lends causal intelligibility to events yet the digital represents an increasingly overflowing stream manifesting itself particularly in the form of notifications and injunctions how do certain digital narratives stage this flow of what happens to us in order to render it coherent on mobile application distribution platforms google play and app store one can find more and more interactive narratives for smartphones or smartfictions picard these fictions rely on ordinary daily practices on a smartphone realtime chats for instance but also notifications what are the principles underlying these smartfictions built around notifications let s take the example of bury me my love enterre moi mon amour this narrative game released in is the fruit of a collaboration between the pixel hunt studio and particularly the game designer florent maurin and the arte france television channel the inspiration for this creation was a witness account published by le monde in the diary of a migrant this http enterremoimonamour arte tv in arabic bury me my love means take good care of yourself whatever you do don t die before i do le journal d une migrante the diary of a migrant https www lemonde fr international visuel dans le telephone d une migrante syrienne_ _ html journal of a young syrian woman migrating to gemany is constituted thanks to a whatsapp thread and then transformed into the interactive fiction bury me my love figure the title screen for enterre moi mon amour in french in this interactive fiction the reader incarnates the character of majd husband of nour the young syrian woman who is attempting to reach europe the reader exchanges messages with nour via an instant messaging platform the duration of the journey between syria and europe is not pre determined it can take anything between a few days and a few months the interaction between the chronology and the temporality of events becomes entwined with the play between cartography and spatiality the reader can follow nour s progression via a gps tracker in the top right corner of the instant messaging screen and so can visualize the character s progression in real time on a map this temporality is also an indication of the reader s progression through the narrative the closer nour gets to a european country the closer the reader is to the end of his her reading experience the tracker is therefore a spatial and temporal indication of both the character s progression and that of the reader in his her reading process the interactive prologue may be acted out here in french http enterremoimonamour arte tv prologue figure map illustrating the character s route as the reader travels along the various pathways there are different possible endings a digital counter indicates the number of days that have passed the border may be temporarily closed or nour might have scheduled a meeting with someone who doesn t turn up on time in such cases is it better to wait or to reconsider your plans your communications will take place in pseudo real time if nour must accomplish an action which is supposed to take her several hours you will not be able to contact her during this time lapse when she returns a notification will inform you that she is again available and that she might need you http enterremoimonamour arte tv figure nour s character is no longer available the reader must wait until she sends him her a notification it is the real time mode which is of interest to us here see the screenshot below it should be noted that the reader has the possibility to disable the mode of real time notifications which is the default mode figure settings for the real time mode the piece plays with temporality through the intrusion of the reader s real time which is then also that of the fictional character the relationship to the reading time is thus altered due to the intrusion of notifications when the user receives a notification from nour amongst other notifications they are incited to dive back into the fictional work to dialogue with the character from a phenomenological perspective we can consider that there is an interruption caused by the injunction behind the notification fictional works built around notifications can disturb the user s time management considerably but at the same time reintroduce their real time into the fictional framework in the same way as locative narratives play on the frontier between fictional space and the reader s real space inciting him her to physically move to a specified place to make the narrative progress narratives built around notifications play on the frontier between fictonal time and the reader s real time what is the added value brought to us by smartfictions which use notifications as part of the narrative process they create the impression of a co presence as readers of or actors in a smartfiction when we make a choice our actions in a way render a fictional character present in our own reality moreover this notion of presence is further reinforced when we respond to a character s sollicitation via a notification in this way we invite the other s temporality as well as that of the fiction to interact with our own the temporality of the fictional character and of events coincides with the reader s temporality via the notifications so that they interiorize the duration of the story it should be noted that for some readers the fact that they must put aside the narrative to wait for a notification may be a factor contributing to disengagement from the narrative in this case it is always possible to disable the notifications such interplay relies prominently on the fact that the smartphone is the device which we use daily for our communication and writing purposes the blurring of reality and fiction is particularly effective as the same device is used for daily communications and for reading playing a fiction if this characteristic lends a reality effect to a fictional narrative we also realize due to the fiction s notifications that have a blurring effect on our own reality that the smartphone is itself in some ways a derealization medium it builds a fictional layer which is external to the real world thanks to such fictional works we come to understand that the smartphone has already become a medium for fiction and for narration bringing a new relationship with temporality and no doubt also reminding us that the fiction vs reality distinction is no longer quite so relevant here narratives built around real time data flows if the digital as we have already pointed out manifests itself through an increasing overflow of data it nonetheless produces this data flow in accordance with a calculatory logic whereby time is precisely no longer present as such absence of horizons of expectation and anticipation as we are dealing with results and not occurrences bachimont in the domain of the digital calculation does away with notions of expectation and what is to come replacing these by the calculatory consequences of the world understood as input data is it possible to re establish a temporal experience notably the power of expectation based on these calculated results here we could quote lifeline or somewhere for example the cartographer s confession by james attlee which is set in london this blurring effect can be found in all the lost phone type smartfictions a normal lost phone another lost phone ana the game in which the user is supposed to have found a phone the content of which messages photos agenda he she is able to flick through in order to understand the protagonist s story in the language of new media lev manovich coins the term of database narratives since then we have been able to measure the growing impact of databases on narrative strategies baroni and gunti p with a whole range of narratives based on data now available we have chosen to focus particularly on narratives based on real time data flows to what extent can a fictional narrative be built around a real time data flow the strongest limit imposed on a narrative by this type of medium is that the causality of events is replaced by the sequentiality of real events chambefort as illustrated in our example below without narrative mediation yet according to certain definitions schmid revaz the causal link between events is a sine qua non condition for narrativity and may even be considered as its key constitutive feature a simple sequence of events or data cannot therefore become a narrative without the intervention of a consciousness and ensuing representation creating a link between them at the same time the technical specificity embodied by reliance on a real time data flow injects life s contingencies into the narrative chambefort let us consider one particular example lucette gare de clichy a web narrative by françoise chambefort built around a real time data base http fchambef fr lucette lucette lives just opposite the clichy levallois station from her window she can see travellers passing by and coming to visit her or not the trains with their strange and familiar bynames are like characters who pay visits to lucette there are very lively moments and moments of great solitude françoise chambefort the work s paratext figure lucette gare de clichy by françoise chambefort this creation is connected to real time through data from the paris region rail network the l line of the transilien network the interface is like a triptych on the left train times are displayed trains may be late or cancelled in the middle is a succession of photographs of lucette the fictional character and on the right we can access her stream of thoughts which are more or less positive depending on how long she must wait for the next train the web reader s attention oscillates between the real and fictional poles of the digital creation if they feel empathy for the character they will live an exceptional temporal experience they will feel the vulnerability of an old person who has little control over her life chambefort the calculated time dimension of the train timetables becomes existential time a waiting period that becomes full of meaning figure the interface in triptych form the fact that this creation is not interactive reinforces the temporal experience the author emphasizes the non interactivity of her creation as if to offer greater incitation to the user to pay more attention to old people suffering from loneliness in the physical world although lucette gare de clichy is of course built around the calculated timescale of a real time data flow it is at the same time a pure experience of time based on the temporal experience of the fictional character chambefort figure transforming a data flow into a temporal experience françoise chambefort refers to her creation as a narrative if we can evoke a narrative it is mainly thanks to the words spoken by lucette her thoughts and the unifying force of her perspective and of her life which she tells us about within this framework yet this creation is no doubt situated at the frontier of what constitutes a narrative as in the previous case indeed bury me my love can be categorized as a narrative game the present work raises the question as to how far we can stretch digital narratives before they cease to be narratives might the digital narratives based on real time data flows and adding signification to them be able to help us to more readily accept the flows of digital data to which we are subjected in our daily lives or even to foster a different relationship with these flows and the temporality which accompanies them from storytelling to storyshowing the stories on social networks our third case study concerns the story feature available on instagram and facebook this feature allows users to display content for a limited twenty four hour period after which it disappears the content of a story can take on all the forms possible for other types of publication videos or photos principally with or without textual commentaries or even just a text additional functions are proposed to enhance these media with static or animated filters layout options or even interactive options such as surveys irrespective of whether the chosen medium is temporal animated video gif or static photo text the length of the story remains limited to seconds and photos or other static media are also presented for viewing for a duration of seconds after which the algorithm automatically passes on to the following story in what we could refer to as the viewer s storyline they can also move on to the following story without waiting for the end of the one being displayed it is possible to create sequences of photos videos texts etc but they will always be displayed as a collection of fragments rather than a unique continuous video sequence click here to see a recording of a viewing screen figure storyline on a facebook computer interface the programmed disappearance can be avoided on story cf https help instagram com helpref hc_fnav bc instagram help bc instagram features facebook conserves archives which are accessible only to the author of a publication we will be using the italics here to distinguish the social media feature from the traditional meaning of story instagram by highlighting a the interface in which the stories are inscribed creates a sort of continuous succession of fragmented sequences which once activated displays a non stop chain of stories until the user interrupts it unlike the newsfeed which requires the user to repeat an interactive swiping gesture to make publications appear on the screen thus each story must not only be adapted to strong temporal and therefore formal constraints but also conform to inclusion in a chain of stories created by algorithms with the inevitable advertisements which are even more ineluctably imposed on users when viewing stories than on the newsfeed even if one can swipe the screen to pass on to the following story as well as to a condemnation to disappearance after a twenty four hour period in short then the characteristics of the story which are of interest to us are the following it bears the name of a discursive mode traditionally reserved for the representation of causally linked events and actions set in time yet it does not impose any criteria for narrativity in the traditional sense it relies indifferently on temporal or atemporal animated or static visual or textual media with nevertheless a strong preference for the visual and the dynamic it is characterized by a double temporal constraint a maximum length of a few seconds internal temporality and a default lifespan of twenty four hours external temporality it is accessed viewing reception within a temporal framework defined by the platform even when non temporal media are concerned it is integrated on viewing in a rapid chain of stories emanating from the viewer s entire network we shall confront the above points with the traditional acceptation and use of the term story ie narrative in a discussion in two parts taking the points in reverse order and the story is separate from its author s other publications from what could constitute the context associated with that particular moment fragment or piece of information belonging to their life friends who are sufficently assiduous in following the author s publications may be capable of reconstructing a narrative but such reconstruction is not aimed at or facilitated by the platforms facebook presents stories as a visual medium which is ideal for sharing authentic moments and this can only be done by going agains the grain of the tool if a user s profile shows a collection of his or her publications in reversed chronological order making it possible to some extent and with great difficulty as such is not the aim to go back in time and perhaps reconstitute a narrative in the true sense of the term even if it is a fragmented and incomplete one and it does not follow the pattern of a narrative as we generally conceive one stories are explicitly and deliberately destined to remain fragments which only the memory of their viewers on facebook in particular it is possible to override some of these limits and to propose a slightly longer video or to make a story visible for a bit longer but these practices remain marginal here we will focus on the basic parameters and practices n b this is also true for the newsfeed but other types of publications remain on the author s profile this becoming part of a sort of journal see the guidelines for companies https www facebook com business help id these are the points which we emphasize here can piece together at the same time the integration of these fragments in the chain of stories of a network of friends contributes to building a form of artificial continuity between the stories of various people and with pages devoted to news or advertising no causal link is established but a more or less simultaneous panorama of moments in peoples lives with no connection between them other than the friendship with the user in question your friends and the ads right now today the narrative identity of each person is of little real interest here not primarily that the friends don t care but because the platform only needs to extract the data from publications that allows it to establish a consumer profile for a given user a profile which has commercial value the narrative identity as yet not constru ct ed as such of the individual thus gets lost in the digital identity of a network which is both a continuous flow of visual information and a pixelated image constructed through a simple algorithmic juxtaposition always in and for the present moment paradoxically then given their name stories separate themselves from the thread of a person s life experience to become part of a snapshot of a social panorama which has no temporal axis and is destined to disappear the individualism behind the self representation and self promotion which seem to motivate users to exploit the story function to share moments of their lives actually contributes in this way to a form of deindividuation which is realised through detemporalization which itself passes through the detour of a minimal temporalization of non temporal media whereby each person s role is limited to enriching the network in all senses of the term each individual and each story to quote pink floyd is just another brick in the others digital wall we have already mentioned the option which consists in proposing a sequence of moments however as we have also seen this does not prevent a fragmentation logic from prevailing facebook also proposes an archive for your own stories but this is only available for the author s own use examples of this can be found in literature thierry crouzet s novel one minute initially published on wattpad in notably presents a sort of narrative panorama which recounts the same minute in time in different places in the world the episodes of this series each designed to be read in little more than a minute recount in turn the same minute from the point of view of new characters the story does not advance in time but in space the intrigue develops little by little from one place to the next and from one time zone to another and heroes emerge as they exchange with their friends or enemies this literary experience which reminds us of postmodern narrative deconstructions nonetheless proposes a coherence between all the minutes of the different characters the whole tradition of microfictions as well as that of mini biographies could of course be used as a basis for comparative analysis mayer and bouchardon put forward the hypothesis of a poetic identity built around a collection of snapshots moments and fugacious impressions which reinforced by social media would coexist alongside ricoeur s narrative identity it is interesting to observe that the platforms and their users present this as an approach aimed at the pureness of the narrative identitarian or visual construction of profiles and or commercial pages instagram s story is a great way to share events as they happen without clogging up your carefully curated feed with dozens of throwaway images your friends and followers might be interested to see what s going on in your life or get a behind the scenes view of what you re working on but they probably want to be able to opt in rather than have it just appear in their feed it s part of instagram s move to be a more complete social network rather than just a place for pretty pictures https www howtogeek com what are stories and why does every social network have them and according to statistics without any indication of the source given by a community manager a practician and blogger who is a specialist on networks and passionate about the subject of people want stories which are short and easy to understand this would explain the emphasis on the visual aspect and on the simplicity of the message in both structure and content thus banning any causal or argumentative construction which would require reflection taking longer than the seconds dedicated to each story facebook s official recommendations indeed insist on the importance of combining visual aspects with speed to best capture the viewer s attention accelerate your rhythm to maintain the attention of your audience the content of stories is viewed much more rapidly than that of other media we suggest you create advertisements which capture the audience s attention right from the first image and that you conserve their attention by playing on the speed of publication and transmission the platforms offer a multitude of models and filters which allow these aims to be materialized facilitating the task of the creators of stories with the above recommendations in mind cf figure figure instagram story templates https www mycmmag com storie contenu impactant sur les reseaux sociaux fbclid iwar ijwpw y wjp ic u h xayqotnmcqsrphalwqlofoarwrve yownpu text we could also emphasize the fact that according to these statistics almost half of users do not indicate any such preference from which we may deduce that they are open to the idea of longer more complex stories which would make users think the trend towards the short and simple is a priori not necessarily a fatality but is alimented by a circuit of supply and demand that encourages this preference through a race for efficiency in advertising communication a study commissioned by snapchat also reveals the greater efficiency of advertisements of seconds over those which last seconds thus confirming the preference among users for extreme brevity even for temporal media https forbusiness snapchat com blog does every second really count a closer look at video ad insights https www facebook com business help id the emphasis is ours micro temporality a preference for the show don t tell approach and the accelerated rhythm inherent to stories are thus greatly motivated by their communicational goal promotion the famous minutes seconds of fame to be hammered into people s consciousness by multiplying the stories as the experts in digital marketing suggest whether for personal or commercial communication inciting engagement and active participation is said to have been the main goal when stories were first introduced on snapchat in whereas in the context of instagram and facebook stories represent an acceleration in relation to other publications which remain available there without any time limit on snapchat they introduced a deceleration compared to the immediate disappearance of standard snaps contrary to the stories prevalent on instagram and facebook those on snapchat consist in piecing together a user s snaps a snap according to snapchat s definition is a moment sent to a friend created in a hour period by assembling them in a chain in which the oldest element disappears as soon as it has reached the end of its hour lifespan and to which new snaps can be added in this manner a sort of fragmented narrative is constructed which resembles what is proposed by the newsfeeds on the other two networks without any time limits the formula was thus substantially transformed on instagram and facebook in spite of their hardly unmeditated adoption of the term story even if it still remains possible to line up successive moments on these networks this adoption precisely marks a convergence between the two temporal and memorial approaches of the three networks initially very divergent with the shared goal of inducing addiction before stories snapchat was a task based social network that means that people would only open the app to take a specific action like checking a notification or sending a message stories transformed it into an app that people wanted to passively check throughout the day people post things all the time so you feel compelled to open the apps and check for content multiple times a day you don t want to miss anything stories take that to another level the temporary aspect of stories drives people to use social networks even more the best engagement tools social media has ever seen stories are just the latest tool to build engagement and keep you in the app the narrative taken in its traditional sense and according to classical and cognitive narratological theories provokes reactions in the receiver by appealing to emotions and other cognitive functions by presenting human experiences and making it possible for them to interpret and integrate these in their life experience this capacity of the narrative is directly linked to the fact that it establishes temporal and causal links however here we witness a completely different https www howtogeek com what are stories and why does every social network have them another study also emphasizes the feature s commercial aim it manages to build a more lasting narrative which provides much better opportunities for brand use in terms of doing things like advertisements offers and marketing campaigns too https techcrunch com snapchat gets its own timeline with snapchat stories hour photo video tales see ricoeur s theory already quoted here as well as the works of monika fludernik david herman nancy easterlin and lisa zunshine among others logic aiming at a simple and immediate emotional response and appealing to our senses vision hearing and to our desire for entertainment and intense immediate pleasure not only does the story thus fail to impose any criteria for narrativity but narrativity also seems to be an obstacle to its immediate efficacy according to the classical definition by gérard genette a narrative is an oral or written discourse which aims to relate an event or a series of events today this definition limited to verbal communication must of course be widened to include other means of communication as the representation mode can also be purely visual or audiovisual it can also be extended by eliminating the reference to events in the manner of richard walsh for whom a narrative is the semiotic articulation of a temporal sequence this is about as far as minimalism can be pushed without losing the specificity of narrative discourse in order to construct a temporal sequence a minimum of two moments are obviously necessary yet everything in the logic behind stories tends towards the equation one story one moment one product one message one joke one simple i e non composite idea and stories are independent from one another thus the story in the way it is conceived and practised on social networks does not rely on narrative in its traditional sense while at the same time exploiting the historical success of the concept and the associated practices a success which must have inspired the choice of the term story in english the new additional meaning of the word has found its place in the dictionary in competition with the traditional significations and to some extent it is only the context which allows us to distinguish between them in french and no doubt in other languages too story remains a word which has been quite recently imported or borrowed and which has been popularized by this novel phenomenon the meanings of the french terms histoire story récit narrative tale and narration could theoretically remain unaffected when we are dealing with the story however some french users also refer to stories as histoires and the meaning of the english term is indeed well known enough to allow the link to be established and to permit retroaction on the traditional meaning of the term histoire which may thus also be see tik tok s creed inspire creativity and bring joy as the latest network to date and the most popular one with young people tik tok merely accentuates a potentiality and aspect present in the other networks at the expense of and or without the burden of deeper communication and sociability in the same way as advertisements generally speaking simply increase the exploitation of the features offered due to their ferocious competition to be the most captivating successful or profitable nevertheless constructing a successful profile or campaign on tik tok requires serious reflection as to the best possible use of the few seconds available to capture the attention of those surfing the data flow however videos can also sometimes go viral without their having been elaborately prepared or promoted if they capure a unique original entertaining moment for example figures iii p richard walsh and susan stepney introduction and overview who what why narrating complexity springer we are of course referring to a global tendency which does not excude the existence of stories which do not follow it facebook allows users to present a short series of photos presented one after the other for example which may constitute a mini narrative composed of several different moments or on instagram the inclusion of several photos in one frame is possible which is similar to presenting a temporal sequence a bit like a page in a cartoon book see for example https www a la home com fr instagram reels vs story difference colonized at least partially by the spirit of stories insurmountable barriers are unlikely to be erected in other languages to block the extension of the meaning of story the only interrogations concern the extent to which the associated practices will become generalized and to what extent users particularly the new generations will prefer these and allow them to take the place of what will still consider today to be real narratives there is of course nothing new about this tendency towards greater brevity simplicity and visual representation stories merely carry this trend to the extreme the story feature in its conception as in its construction and the uses it offers is inseperable from its digital environment not so much because this environment is by definiton and by its very nature detemporalizing but because the underlying calculations in both the mathematical and economic strategic senses of the word are driven by commercial logic rather than by social or cultural aims from this perspective the story simply intensifies the logic behind storytelling by taking advantage of the potential for emotional impact inherent in stories but here completely deprived of its hi story in both senses the past of narratives and the narrative content as well as of its spirit since temporality is only useful in this context insofar as it helps to observe changes in behavior and even then only the result is of importance the problem is therefore not so much that an atemporal calculation is the basis for the functioning of the digital but rather that its uses are dominated by economic powers which alone have the capacity both the necessary resources and the accumulated know how to invent and implement features to be proposed to users or even to impose these by exploiting very human desires and impulses this does not however impede the emergence of creative practices we have already witnessed some examples such as the micro booktrailers proposed by the new york public library on instagram futher questions in our current digital environment constructing and transmitting a narrative in the classical sense of the term a practice which requires time or creating experimental forms which question the limits of the narrative form without immediately providing a satisfactory answer both imply swimming against the tide rendered stronger by the features made available by the owners of the social networks which dominate our communications we have presented two fictional works which raise these questions in their own ways built around two current phenomena in our digital lives and which do not yet hold an established place in narrative disourse notifications and data flows the former allows creators to introduce and integrate fictional time into the reader s real time whilst the latter uses the real time of events taking place in the real world to structure a fictional work lending meaning to a flow of information and transforming it into a human experience these two examples also show that interactivity and dataflows raise questions around temporality as this inevitably becomes entwined with that of fictionality and its limits the robert french dictionary has already integrated the term qualifying it as an anglicism with the following definition image ou brève vidéo publiée par un internaute sur un réseau social et visible pendant une courte durée image or time https dictionnaire lerobert com definition story https www instagram com stories highlights short video published by a web user and visible for a short length of inviting creators and users to rethink these borders and the traditional binary distinction between fiction and reality if the classical narrative aims for and encourages the immersion of the reader viewer through movement from real space time towards fictional space time the new narrative forms allow the emergence of fictional space time in and thanks to real space time via a movement that not only crosses but also deconstructs frontiers while these two works question the relations between narrative temporality and digital environment our third example invites us to rethink our conception of narrative as it is defined by classical and post classical narratology adopting the term and using it to designate entirely different phenomena and practices this radical otherness expresses itself through the relation to time the temporality imposed by the feature that of the content it proposes and that of the users we have seen how the temporality of stories is doubly limited by the networks to an internal duration of a few seconds and to a lifespan of one day we are in the sphere of the moment aneous and the ephemeral neither of which are designed to foster lasting memories or at least not to take their place in the archives but which are nonetheless there to be seen to have a double and slightly prolonged existence thanks to these forms of representation but always as moments the function of these stories is no longer to establish temporal or causal links between events but simply to include them in what could be referred to as the life of the network s that enormous constantly changing pixelated showcase the cohesion of which is only guaranteed by links of friendship another term which has undergone an evolutionary process since its adoption by the networks to refer to the links between their members we should probably avoid trying to essentialize time and think rather in terms of digital space vitali rosati marcello vitali rosati invites us to consider narratives in relation to spatiality rather then temporality temporality is linear before and after whereas on the internet we are especially confronted with relations of distance and proximity of visibility and invisibility of accessibility and inaccessibility of the central position and the peripheral that is to say with creating a space on the internet we notably create our collective identity through spatial interactions and even the notion of editorialization is defined by vitali rosati as the set of dynamics which produce our digital space it is precisely in this digital space that stories also take form the succession of moments with no other link between them than their juxtaposition by an algorithm and judging by what we can see without any consideration for the content is presented in the digital space with the frames of each of the stories lined up available for the user to consult and then launch the viewing process following their temporal sucession rather than a narrative sequence constructed by a person the user receives a sequence compiled by an algorithm the moment or the content editorialized by the person who has lived or created this moment integrates a second process algorithmic and opaque this time which operates its inclusion in a sequence of other moments and contents created by other people it is more a question of procedure and performance than narrative as construed by ricoeur a temporal construction which does not create or modify meaning but nevertheless fills a the our digital space on this subject see fülöp in paul ricoeur observed that new narrative forms which we do not yet know how to name are already being born which will bear witness to the fact that the narrative function can still be metamorphosed but not so as to die ricoeur the question we may ask ourselves today is how extensive this metamorphosis might be and how far can we push the limits of the narrative function without it losing its meaning the meaning attributed to it by ricoeur are we today witnessing a fundamental transformation of what we call narrative are our desire and need for oldstyle narrative strong enough to resist the planetary tide of stories and the networks and algorithmic processes powers of redefinition should we be afraid of such an evolution could not such a change be inscribed in the long history of human civilisations which have already seen so many transformations including the birth of the narrative as we still know it today the above questions suggest that the stake here is not simply what might happen to narrative forms but what might happen to us deprived of narrative in the classical sense and how we might function without it in other words to what extent are our consciousness and our powers of reflection truly dependent on narratives and how prepared are we to consider alternative modes of functioning for instance would thinking by and through network as primary structure be possible with the cohesion of moments and fragments would be created by connections other than the temporal and or causal ones we may not be facing a total and definitive disappearance of narratives but rather a relativisation of their place in our culture history and theoretical constructions and a multiplication of modes of representing and performing time we must however recognize that for now we are still inside the system of thought where narrative seems not only indispensable but also very dominant and are incapable of thinking beyond the narrative as a framework for intelligibility can thus be seen as one of those great narratives whose demise was announced by lyotard but which continue to stucture our perception of the world the past the present and the future when we tell the story of narrative and of the evolution of stories on the network with the challenge they present to traditional narrative the latter stands firm supported by the weight of its history and we too easily confer the role of the bad guy to the newcomer as we in turn enter into the polarizing logic of storytelling it is only when we open our minds to the idea that other paths are possible that we can engage in serious and nuanced reflection about the evoluton of our relationship to narrative to time and to technology references bachimont b le sens de la
