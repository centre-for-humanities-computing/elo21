à montréal introduction the children s and young adults digital content market is growing at a fast pace and already represents a considerable share of the editorial field both in terms of downloads and distribution as of april mobile apps labelled as suitable for children were available in the apple app store and in the google play curry corresponding respectively to and of the listing volume overall in quebec where nine out of ten households are connected to the internet cefrio several public industries multimedia companies as well as big and small print publishers have realized important investments to develop new content and new distribution paths both adapting their previous catalogues and experimenting innovative technological solutions for instance télé québec has launched a collection of augmented adaptations of print picturebooks intended for primary school pupils fonfon a print children s publisher has developed a catalogue of mobile apps la pastèque in collaboration with la puce à l oreille a quebecois startup specialized in audio content has recently launched several podcasts meant to extend the print picturebooks reading experiences this editorial effort was accompanied by an impressive augmentation of digital books borrowings especially during the pandemic according to the figures published by the pretnumerique ca platform and the statements of the director of the quebecois digital library bibliopresto jean françois cusson in québec an impressive increase of children s books borrowings was observed in in the comic books section in the picturebooks and novels one and in non fictional category levesque for previous reports see https bibliopresto ca publications php at the same time educational policies have proven receptive to digital literacy issues and sensitive to the importance of introducing digital and multimodal content in the ordinary curricula in particular the digital action plan plan d action numérique released by the ministry of education and higher education in has stressed the importance of systematically including digital content and digital competencies in the st century educational programs by insisting on the objectives targeted in the educational success policy politique de la réussite éducative that were already aimed at better integrating the st century skills and the possibilities of digital technology the quebecois digital action plan defines measures intended to achieve nine objectives referring to three major orientations all centered on the needs of educational communities the first concerns the modernization of the educational offer the promotion of digital culture and the development of digital skills and competencies among both young people and adults the second aims at improving the use of technology for teaching and learning by encouraging innovative practices establishing efficient systems for sharing digital resources and activities and deploying new and varied distance educational offers based more on learners needs and realities finally the third orientation focuses on the educative curricula themselves on the implementation of digital tools to accompany students progressions throughout their education and on the development of fair and safe conditions to access digital technologies mees within this framework the digital competency framework cadre de référence de la compétence numérique released as the first measure of the digital action plan has identified twelve dimensions corresponding to as many competencies and skills that young quebecers need to master in order to become increasingly autonomous in their use of digital technologies in educational or professional contexts as well as in everyday life mees p digital reading skills and competencies appear transversal both at primary and secondary levels and cover most of the twelve dimensions they are fundamental for developing and mobilizing technological skills dimension collaborating communicating and producing content via digital technology dimensions and developing critical thinking with regard the use of digital technology dimension adopting an innovative and creative approach the use of digital technology dimension mees however despite the sector dynamism and the interest of institutions teachers and researchers towards digital content and digital literacy children s e literature still presents major issues in terms of production distribution and diffusion developers publishers and educators admit their difficulties and their partial knowledge of the editorial offer of the creative processes of the reading modes and habits in the digital environments especially those of young readers thus in order to support the digital transformation of the quebec youth e publishing sector and facilitate both the discoverability bisaillon of its products and their use in school context a team of researchers from different disciplinary fields education literature and art and partners from the publishing or media fields set out to document the issues needs and realities of the contemporary digital market between and as part of the project support for digital publishing initiatives for young people in quebec based on favorable production distribution and reception practices lacelle et al more particularly the research had three objectives identifying and documenting the needs challenges and best practices in the production distribution and reception of children s digital literary works co constructing adapted reference tools to analyze and solve the specific issues faced by publishers and educators in conceiving diffusing and distributing such works developing an action plan for the development of innovative e publishing

martel uqar lévis moniques richard uqam élaine turgeon uqam data was gathered via semi structured interviews with different actors involved in producing distributing or accompanying the reception of children s digital literary works a preliminary inquiry with primary and secondary levels teachers was conducted in in order to describe their knowledge of e literary creations and their effective use two cycles of interviews were then conducted with print or digital publishers developers and producers that already had significant experience in digital children s publishing and wished to further exploit the potential of technology for their creations by identifying and overcoming the issues needs and problems encountered during the creation production or distribution phases their statements coupled with an inquiry on their needs expectations and ambitions as well as scientific literature reviews of digital reading and writing practices led to identify several major issues undermining or slowing their initiatives in parallel a close look at their production at the contents available and at the platforms effectively developed in the last five years offered a clear portrait of the current orientations of the digital children s literature publishing field in quebec in this article we present the lab yrinhte ca website and virtual laboratory which results from the previous research and meets its goals on one side by depicting the major issues encountered by publishers and educators and suggesting recommendations and best practices and on the other side by offering a detailed and up to date catalogue of the current digital children s literature offer after having introduced the context of the website and virtual laboratory we will present its content and intentions in more detail context of the virtual laboratory educators and publishers statements gathered through the interviews have revealed three major issues that seem to hinder the production and the distribution of digital literary content for young readers as well as their diffusion in school contexts caption the first one refers to the lack of knowledge about the current editorial offer by educators librarians and more generally by common readers genres technological solutions and formats multimodal combinations poetic and rhetorical effects of literary creations seem to be insufficiently known however just like educators and teachers stockless and villeneuve publishers and authors feel insecure about their e literary knowledge and claim they would need a more in depth training on the specificities of digital literature as well as on the processes of its production and creation they equally insist on the importance of improving their collaborations with digital media actors and other print publishers in order to imbibe ideas creative solutions literary and artistic tendencies of their contemporary cultural ecosystem at the same time as a necessary part of their acculturation respondents educators and publishers mention the importance of creating and accessing dedicated spaces to discover children s e literature initiatives especially those of independent studios often drowned by the commercial and marketing strategies of bigger competitors the second issue is related to young readers specificities and pertains more particularly to the psycho cognitive and affective process involved in digital reading which largely goes beyond publishers and creators expertise on several occasions during the interviews respondents have claimed their wish to know better young readers development needs and to capitalize more effectively on the features of the technological devices and environments supporting learning and teaching activities similarly even when they consider the school context as an ideal market for their creations several respondents admit their difficulty at picturing the class realities and the activities teachers and students may realize with children s e literature moreover they find information about classroom equipment hard to access and thus difficult to adjust their content for the devices and the operative systems that are actually available and frequently used at school with such uncertainties about school practices and young readers competencies skills and needs children s e literary texts are often standardized in terms of technological solutions and para pedagogical enhancements on one side publishers and authors tend to prefer formats and interfaces that do not dramatically reformulate the print book codes and formats on the other side they overstress the educative orientation of their productions by adding more or less standardized tools to support the decoding stage the literal comprehension or the learning of vocabulary the third difficulty emerges with slight differences between teachers librarians and literary mediators and refers to the lack of guiding materials to present and analyze digital creations with young audiences more particularly teachers struggle to include e literary creations in the school canon and mostly restrict their digital reading sessions to the use of digitized adaptations of print texts even if their technological equipment would support more interactive and dynamic texts again the unfamiliarity with digital texts with their poetics and their potential didactic usages seems to represent an obstacle to the implementation of new practices caption the graphic presents the major issues in production distribution and reception of children s e literary contents identified through the analysis of publishers and educators statements lab yrinthe an online laboratory for educators and publishers in order to reduce the limitations observed during this research to stimulate reading practices and to help educators developing young readers competencies in digital literacy a website and a virtual laboratory dedicated to children s digital creation has been conceived in partnership with the littérature quebecoise mobile partnership directed by bertrand gervais lab yrinthe the website launched in may is intended as a virtual laboratory on the contemporary children s digital literary phenomena and aims at providing information based on scientific observations as well as conceptual and didactic tools for educators publishers and researchers the website is thus organized into six sections the first section introduces the team and the mission of the website the second addressed to teachers editors and students offers detailed descriptions of e literary children s works the third directed to publishers presents recommendations and advice based both on the research and on literature reviews the fourth more oriented towards educators and teachers contains descriptions of theoretical concepts and notions of digital literature as well as indications to include digital literature specificities in the literature class the fifth illustrates some of the projects followed during the research the last containing four sub sections compile relevant news events book releases conferences etc on digital literature in quebec a portrait of children s e lit the digital works section of the lab yrinthe website presents a catalog of heterogeneous digital literary works produced or distributed in quebec including enriched books mobile apps narrative video games geolocated narrations augmented reality creations interactive theater performances virtual installations and podcasts caption each creation is analyzed from a set of descriptive parameters conceived by the research team acerra lacelle et al with the purpose of illustrating the semiotic multimodal and technological materials of the text as well as the poetic or rhetorical effects of their combinations moving from a consideration of digital literature as an amalgam of literary and technological components and methodologically choosing to identify elements that repeatedly appear regardless of the formal and stylistic specificities of each textual typology we took account of three interdependent levels the first one describes the formal structures of children s literary texts the second focuses on content representation modes and the third one puts the accent on the types of interactions required for the empirical subject the analysis of the formal structures allowed to classify digital literary works according to their genres and the different roles given to their model reader on one side we were able to distinguish creations displaying linearity and sequentiality from others presenting non linear structures tabular or multiple paths depending totally or in part on the readers choices on the other side the implied postures of the readers led to classify works according to the kind of interventions required for young readers and eventually to distinguish creations favouring playful encounter linear reading or sound or tactile discovery regarding the dimension of content representation modes we adapted the aarseth model and identified works in which the textual materials remain fixed for the entire time of the reading session or evolve according to the readers requests or to semi automated devices and programs orders we therefore distinguished creations allowing to reactivate replay and relaunch elements already read seen listened to or played under the same conditions as the first reading from those suggesting a number of variations from the first execution by focusing more precisely on textual materials accessibility we classified digital children s e literary works according to the conditions allowing the content to display textual materials could either appear in a clear and immediate way or be blurred delayed and hindered finally by considering the interactivity a mediated and programmed possibility of choice and action archibald and gervais p we identified works in which the readers actions and gestures provoke a modification in the narrative scheme in the computer code or in the representation of the text itself within this category we distinguished digital works programming compulsory and explicitly required manipulations from others requiring optional and implicit interventions following this descriptive parameters grid we analyzed each digital work and presented their structures and main themes as well as their user experiences according to the different devices and their technologies each record was completed by some educational and didactic suggestions both based on the works themes and on their techno literary features this subsection directed to teachers is meant to offer some reading and analysis keys and at the same time to suggest clear examples of the possible exploitations of digital texts in school context caption an overview of the digital works catalog keywords regarding the main concepts and notions of digital literature mobilized in the descriptions are linked to the education section where more detailed theoretical and critical information is provided a repertory of educative tools the education section of the website is more specifically dedicated to introducing in an accessible language a selection of concepts and theories necessary to teach digital literature present e literary genres and describe the techno literary features to young audiences each entry summarizes theoretical and critical works about for instance the multimodality framework the notion of genre in e literary theory the concepts of lability and obsolescence or the opposition between linearity and non linearity caption these aspects are finally observed in an educative and didactic perspective underlining the elements that young readers should be aware of in order to read understand interpret and appreciate digital literary creations their codes and their specificities educators are supposed to refer to this section of the website to enter the e literary critiques and to identify the elements necessary to train young audiences publishers may consult this section to examine other publishing or self publishing choices and to be eventually reinvested in the development of innovative relevant and varied children s content caption an overview of the contents analyzed in the education section recommendations for publishers resulting from seven research reports dedicated to analyzing the major issues that emerged during the data collection the need for publishers and creators to improve their knowledge of digital cultures techn olog ical savoir faire funding possibilities discoverability paths scientific results school practices readers behaviors and habits the publishing section offers recommendations to answer publishers concerns it consists of nine modules organized in a similar tripartite structure after a recall of five participants key quotes caption the first part of each notice describes several aspects of the topics that members of our sample considered problematic caption the digital professions module for instance first presents an overview of the issue at hand and explains how the complexification of the creative process in the digital environment and more particularly the necessary involvement of several analogue and digital experts authors graphic artists developers sound creators narrative architects etc may represent a challenge for several print publishers the following four subsections respectively analyze the temporal constraints associated with the digital production scheduling the roles of the creative technical and educative poles ideally involved in the design and development processes their possible interactions and the missions of the so called digital passeurs lieutier who may facilitate the communication between the different creative units finally the last part of the module presents five recommendations which may support publishers and creators to overcome their barriers and difficulties caption an example of key quotes presented in the publishing section caption an example of the observations concerning the issues emerged during the research partnership projects the fourth section of the website is aimed at presenting the main projects carried out in partnership with several actors from the quebecois cultural industry ranging from the national television public libraries and archives to independent picturebook publishers local poetry events and bookfairs promoters each record recalls the goals of the partner s e publishing initiatives and the expectations regarding the collaboration with the research team moreover answering to the second main objective of the research co constructing reference tools adapted to analyze and solve the specific issues faced by publishers and educators in conceiving diffusing and distributing digital works this section of the website describes the approaches actions and solutions effectively adopted by the responsible researcher s to support the development the production the distribution or the mediation with teachers literary mediators or young readers in this case publishers and producers requests fell within five axes of requirements in this case publishers and producers requests fell within five axes of support requirements the first was strictly related to the need of acquiring a proper and secure digital culture partners wanted to know the specificities of children s digital literature better as well as the economic technological and temporal constraints implied in digital publishing processes the second axis partially linked to the previous one pertains to the need to access popularized scientific works in didactics as well as in digital and multimodal literacy publishers and creators felt necessary to understand teachers and programs orientations better and at the same time to distinguish approximations and clichés about children and screens from objective data the third pole of requests was product oriented several partners asked for support in conceptualizing user experiences defining aims for interactive or audio elements inscribed in their creations identifying remediations strategies or even writing some narratives in this context a fourth axis more specifically focused on developing content and enhancements for school uses emerged the research team was therefore solicited to create pedagogical resources and content suggest digital functionalities and study the relevance of specific features or elements finally a fifth pole of needs and requests concerned the mediation dimension researchers were asked to offer presentations about digital books to different audiences to conceive and organize innovative physical spaces for promoting e literary creations and to test the efficiency of some mediation strategies chosen by the different partners conclusion where we are and where we want to go lab yrinthe is the result of an ambitious project and of the will shared by all the researchers of the multimodal media literacy lmm research team to create a favorable ecosystem to observe and support new texts and new practices the website will be constantly enriched with new content both to update the catalog of digital publications and to follow the evolution of the dynamics of production distribution and reception of children s e literature the results of a survey about the pandemic effects on the development processes on the audience uses as well as on sales and downloads will be published soon as a module in the publishing section information on the legal aspects associated with the use of digital content in school context will also be added in june as they seem to be a source of concern for publishers and an area of highly uneven and not always legitimate practices among teachers without abandoning its ambitious nature lab yrinthe aspires to become a laboratory of reading and writing practices eventually the website will be the showcase for a multidisciplinary team of emergent digital artists and developers and will describe their work creative processes and artistic choices by cultivating its educational vocation it will also continue to gather and analyze new school practices co creating with teachers pupils and students new patterns for reading and
