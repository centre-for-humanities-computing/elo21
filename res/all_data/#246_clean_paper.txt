currently serves as an advisor to the mixed augmented reality art research organisation and is a senior research affiliate of the humanities and critical code studies lab among other responsibilities v r erses is a collection of d online experiences of x reality virtual mixed and augmented created by mez breeze in collaboration with other well known e lit artists in this paper i argue that this work inquiries into the posthuman scenario that is on the impact of human and nonhuman actions in the anthropocene in the case of electronic literature and net art a central concern has been the role of software considered by some a sort of disembodied haunting voice of the ghost in the machine in theory as praxis the poetics of electronic textuality johanna drucker turned to jerome mcgann s radiant textuality to assert that the aristotelian s concept of poïesis nowadays conceptualized only as theory was in its ancient greek original meaning a form of making or craft see also lópez varela according to drucker making things pushes the horizons of one s understanding decades later there is still the need to call attention to the practical aspects of humanities disciplines the aims of this paper are multiple it attempts to show how art and in this case mez breeze s net art foregrounds contemporary problems such as the possible agency of nonhuman actants it also calls for a blend of stem disciplines into ste a m in order to highlight the e consilience of all knowledge keywords anthropocene nonhuman agency mez breeze vr xr v r erses human readable messages and nonhuman intra actions in mez breeze published a book entitled human readable messages mezangelle on the back cover of her volume she poses the following question to the readers q wot do u get if u stitch gether standardized literary conventions think the monumental output of bill shakespeare the staccato pulsings of emily dickinson with coded poetics steeped in digitally drenched communication this is her description of mezangelle a type of codework she developed in the s and which she used to write her book in diary form mezangelle which breeze spells without capitals is a new form of writing that combines english language with some code features embodied embedded enacted extended of programming languages such as ascii code fragments of markup language protocol code and others her choice of denomination echoes not only her own name but also the musical pieces known as villanelle for readers who cannot interpret code features the simple bracketing of letters within words enables the emergence of multiple meanings the result is similar to the portmanteau words used by lewis carroll in his poem jabberwocky other authors such as james joyce in his novel finnegans wake or william burrough s cut ups are examples of a struggle to break down the linearity of alphabetic writing lópez varela her poem anthropo s ceney anthropo bs cene which appeared in in netwurker livejournal com is an example of mezangelle mostly made up of bracketing the poem is a meditation on the anthropocene a term that has come to signify our current age in geological time marked by the beginning of humanity s effects on the environment on a global scale coined by chemist paul j crutzen and marine biologist eugene f stoermer the term emphasises human impact on the planet characterized by encounters with nonhuman agents thus it considers the material inter actions and intra actions that occur between organisms and their environments in the anthropocene the need arises to consider forms of intentionality that come from nonhuman entities the category of the nonhuman includes biological forms animal plants microorganisms as well as non biological entities such as machines and forthcoming forms of ai in his essay finding and evaluating the code david shepard divides code into different layers in digital work the executed layer structural layers and the source code all of which contribute in meaning making in deeper into the machine learning to speak digital hayles mentions mez breeze as member of a new generation of artists who produce works where natural language mingles with the language of the machine producing a creole comprised of english and computer code for hayles this new trend is not content to let code remain below the surface but rather its purpose is to show it erupting through the surface of the screen to challenge the hegemony of alphabetic language hayles indeed breeze s mezangelle recombinations contribute to the emergence of a multiplicity of meanings that create an effect of defamiliarization this mechanism introduced in by russian formalist viktor shklovsky in his essay art as technique sought to explore the phonetic and lexical structure of a given distribution of words in order to find material to remove the automatism of perception and cognition shklovsky considered that works of art should modify perception in order to raise cognitive awareness to how knowledge is produced by means of language codework is reminiscent of other techniques used to subvert power structures and their alphabetic language vehicle we have already mentioned lewis carroll and james villanelle were forms of light italian secular vocal music originating in naples around the subject matter was generally rustic comic satirical and parodic it was a polifonic genre performed by two or more unaccompanied voices singing in combination and with equal importance short phrases were taken up by the voices one after another in fugal imitation after two or three repetitions of a phrase the succeeding one was introduced commonly overlapping or displacing the previous mezangelle blends human discourse with machine code in a form that resembles lewis carroll s portmanteau words the term referred to a travelling suitcase that opened into two equal sections breeze s bracketed blends physically resemble the carrying handles of such suitcase the meaning of mezangelle travels in the sense that it is fugitive its form enables a multitude of meanings emerging from a broken word mezangelle is also often satirical calling attention to issues that need pressing solutions defamiliarization in russian ostranenie was the technique of presenting to audiences common things in an unfamiliar or strange way so they could gain new perspectives and see the world differently the techique has deeply influenced th century art and theory from dada to culture jamming the relationship with sigmund freud s notion of the uncanny is also explored in breeze s creations particularly in her v r erses joyce s portmanteau words in his essay the electronic revolution william burroughs imagines language as a virus spreading by means of institutionalized means and hegemonic structures his cut ups were conceived as a form of breaking the order of things in michel foucault s words to use post pandemic terms mezangelle can be seen as an inoculation of a small portion of pharmakon derrida a vaccine or antidote but also a poison that incorporates political antigens in order to subvert the infection of power roberto simanowski writes that code is an indispensable element in every discussion of digital arts because everything happening on the screen or on the scene is first and foremost subject to the grammar and politics of code viii levels mobilizing the introduction of codework in the poem produces a virus like infection at various the epistemological the poem recalls encounters in the anthropocene where humans meet nonhuman agents whose intra actions signalled by mark up language indicate a condition in which none of the actants pre exists their relationship in a sort of multi verse process ontology the ontological and in poïesis the aesthetic in meeting the universe halfway quantum physicist karen barad proposed the concept of intra action to explain that relata do not preexist relations rather relata within phenomena emerge through specific intra actions she adds that phenomena should be understood as a matter of intra acting it is an enactment not something that someone or something has barad describes her agential realist account as one where discursive practices are not human based activities but rather specific material re configurings of the world through which local determinations of boundaries properties and meanings are differentially enacted in her account matter is substance in its intra active becoming not a thing but a doing a congealing of agency and performativity is iterative intra activity furthermore for barad agency is a distributed condition where we are not outside observing the world nor are we simply located at particular places in the world rather we are part of the world in its ongoing intra activity emphasis in the original in this way mez breeze s works can be seen as performing a reflection on how code disrupts the so called natural human language forcing an inquiry into the possibility of machine agency an agency that depends both on machine languages and on the materiality of the platforms used to support language inter intra actions enaction and material engagement theory before moving on to explore breeze s v r erses i would like to provide a brief insight into the theories that have expanded the notion of en action as stated before my argument in this paper is that theory explanation and performance are but two sides of poïesis the term enaction was first introduced by humberto maturana and francisco varela in their ground breaking volume the tree of knowledge the biological roots of human understanding to these authors enact means to bring forth a notion connected to their theory of autopoiesis biological systems are autopoietic meaning that they are proactive self organizing and self regulating in particular spatiotemporal spans the term enaction seems to be a blend of enabling emergent action to maturana and varela inter intra actions can bring forth forms of meaning making between organisms and their environment see also hoffmeyer in lópez varela more recently enactivism has become part of a cluster of related theories known as the es which include embodiment embedding enaction and more recently the extended mind hypothesis in relation to encounters in the anthropocene the authors of the embodied mind explain that the key point then is that the species brings forth and specifies its own domain of problems this domain does not exist out there in an environment that acts as a landing pad for organisms that somehow drop or parachute into the world instead living beings and their environments stand in relation to each other through mutual specification or codetermination varela thompson and rosch in its most recent versions the extended mind clark and chalmers and material engagement theory met malafouris enactivism emphasizes material agency from a non anthropocentric point of view opening the way to nonhuman actions their arguments is that artefacts are integral to the development of the human mind and that active engagement with material things signs brings forth meaning making that is semiotic activity form and meaning emerge simultaneously through coupling mechanisms with the environment a sort of visual code or language and thus invites reading malafouris the functional anatomy of the human mind which includes the whole organism that is brain cns and body is a dynamic bio cultural construct subject to continuous ontogenetic and phylogenetic transformation by behaviourally important and socially embedded experiences these experiences are mediated and sometimes constituted by the use of material objects and artefacts e g the blind man s stick which for that reason should be seen as continuous integral and active parts of the human cognitive architecture malafouris what can these theories bring to the study of electronic literature and net art which are the forms of agency that need to be recognized in the posthuman anthropocene scenario from the holodeck to mez breeze s v r erses the holodeck is a fictional device from the television series star trek it was first introduced in an episode called the practical joker which brings interesting hermetic associations i cannot include in this paper perhaps just a quick reminder that hermes is the messenger of the gods s he who brings information holography was possibly the first step towards virtual reality the introduction of multidimensional spatiotemporal contexts enabled by the holodeck platform allowed star trek protagonists to question their self awareness and existence posing metaphysical questions as to the nature of reality lewis carroll performed a similar inquiry in his alice books in particular through his exploration of one of the earliest forms of optical platform the looking glass see lópez varela breeze s v r erses allow a reflection on how we look at the world through our screens which are also optical objects if mezangelle inscribes in hayles terms human and machine languages in emergent forms of enaction enabling a multitude of voices the incorporation of d images in breeze s latest creations adds layers of semiotic inter intra actions v r erses are ambiguously described by their author both as a sequence of video poems and as micro stories each v r erse is what breeze calls a storybox that can be http mezbreezedesign com vr literature vrerses xr story series mez currently serves as an advisor to the mixed augmented reality art research organisation https marart org home experienced in d in any webxr device indeed each v r erse is a pandora box that enables unexpected en actions the original ancient greek term for the container was pithos a large jar used for storage of food supplies but also used ritually as a burial urn the term is related to pathos grief for opening the box liberated the spirits who created great suffering and distress for humans however opening pandora box came to signify that making mistakes and overcoming difficulties was the only way to become wise however as in eve s biblical story the key element of pandora s narrative was establishing who was to blame in other words with whom lies the responsibility for the actions breeze s storyboxes inquire into the relocation of the blame and responsibility to the reader user thus remediating the social biggs and engaging the audience into our global problems v r erses which first appeared in offers a verbovicovisual experience to use james joyce s terms enhanced with the inclusion of d images that incorporate text nodes these nodes open up the different micro stories and require direct manipulation by the reader user in order to reconfigure the sequence in a given direction however their numbering helps the reader build the first sequence which s he can later alter almost like an artificial neural network the nodes seem to be organized in a sort of directed acyclic graph where each input creates an adjustment interestingly the nodes occupy the entire body of the nonhuman entities under display signalling the semiotic embodying of language and communication in ann systems layers talk to one another until the output layer is reached serving as the network s answer this is what happens in each of breeze s story boxes a recent review in neural online journal describes v r erses as virtual objects of literature they are exactly that skeletal objects that ooze lines from their joints they include hybrid human nonhuman entities cyborgs human animal plant hybrids mythological beings like dragons or alien and ghostly creatures from other dimensions the reading experience re embodies these entities when they are manipulated in three dimensional space this manipulation in space offers a glimpse to life in other planes of existence each story box is also packed with intriguing sonic backgrounds at the moment there are thirteen d video pieces with micro stories authored by well known e lit artists like the holodeck in start trek all the video stories explore different aspects of the self contemplating a sort of metamorphous multi verse where the famous statement by pierre teilhard de chardin is embodied we are not human beings having a spiritual

cursing him at the bitching hour posthuman agency one of the characteristics of online e lit is the fact that it incorporates greater possibilities for interactivity audience participation serves to illustrate how agency is the emergent product of semiotic enactivism material engagement theory considers that things operate as signs and that meaning is not the product of representation but the product of a process of conceptual integration between conceptual and material domains malafouris thus met can be seen as an attempt to decouple agency from human consciousness and to modulate intentionality toward the nonhuman i have used mez breeze s creations as an example that shows that things inscribed and embodied are not inert matter they have the power to affect others and to be affected by them the power to remediate the social biggs breeze s v r erses highlight agency beyond the human in many ways for instance by means of her disquieting hybrid bio mechanical figures the micro stories that accompany them also question human sense of self in her book how we became posthuman n katherine hayles traced the different waves of cybernetics and explained that the posthuman is made up of various forms of embodiment and inscription breeze s v r erses enable these new forms where materiality is not relegated to a second order of things hayles flickering signifiers characterized by their tendency toward unexpected metamorphoses attenuations and dispersions virtual bodies and flickering signifiers become xr in breeze s v r erses storybox spaces where the signifier exists as a flexible chain of markers bound together by the arbitrary relations specified by the relevant codes a signifier on one level becomes a signified on the next higher level ibid the symbolic moment when the human confronts the posthuman ibid john cayley emphasizes that the encounter of languages enacts an unstable semiotic form that it is not merely a chain of signifiers ending up in unveiling code as text codework a term used for the first time by alan sondheim in was described by talan memmott as an anti genre for cayley code is not necessarily transparent or visible in human readable language but if read primarily as the language displayed on a screen then its address is simplified it is addressed to a human reader who is implicitly asked to assimilate the code as part of natural language he concludes that the code is not the text unless it is the text as it happens in breeze s mezangelle cayley also highlights the double political and aesthetic intent in codework creations making visible the agencies of inscription performed by the machine and showing the deep remixability manovich and dynamic heterarchy hayles of the couplings between the biological and the technological roy ascott was prophetic when he forecasted the future of art as a synthesis of different art forms a gesamtdatenwerk the integrated data work which emulates the thcentury concept of the gesamtkunstwerk while it is concerned with both technology and poetry the virtual and the immaterial as well as the palpable and concrete the telematic may be categorized as neither art nor science while being allied in many ways to the discourses of both ascott emphasis added indeed mez breeze s v r erses exemplify the new multidirectional ste a m topologies of knowledge braidotti that emerge with the posthuman her micro stories question one s locations in terms of both space geo political or ecological dimension and time historical and genealogical dimension braidotti concrete examples are for instance v r erse antelooper in v r erse vinity in v r erse curve or in v r erse the touch all of which stress the limited nature of all claims to knowledge braidotti reporting on transmediale berlin s festival for art and digital culture benjamin busch asks the question does agency lie in the human the machine or the mediation in between he goes on to define machine agency in two ways a negative freedom from a refusal of things as they are and a positive freedom to a refusal and simultaneously future building project n p freedom and resistance are related to will and agency a topic that many of breeze s v r erses also pick up see for instance v r erse bracement v r erse formu e lation or v r erse power_b ar k cing the anthropocene shows the impact nonhuman agency upon human lives this includes the kind of vibrant matter jane bennett has in mind where things have propensities or tendencies of their own viii and also the couplings that stacy alaimo describes as transcorporeality in bodily natures both concepts are much alive in breeze s v r erses coda this paper has focused on work by australian net artist mez breeze briefly exploring her collection of poems micro stories entitled v r erses i have argued that her use of mezangelle and mixed xr produces new forms of agency materialisation that contribute to make visible the emergence of nonhuman actants in the anthropocene enabling also an inquiry into the newly emerging multidimensional topologies of knowledge in breeze s creations the languages of the machine emerge as an expression of agency in v r erses this inquiry is directed towards different forms of symbiosis enacted from the encounters or couplings between the human and the nonhuman references alaimo stacy bodily natures science
