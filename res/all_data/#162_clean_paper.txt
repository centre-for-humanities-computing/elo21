repetition and defamiliarization in ai dungeon and project december alex mitchell department of communications and new media national university of singapore alexm nus edu sg introduction recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for the exploration of creative interactive works based around generative text this paper compares two such works ai dungeon walton and project december rohrer a both of which are built on the same artificial intelligence ai platforms openai s gpt and gpt in ai dungeon the player can choose from several predetermined worlds each of which provide a starting point for the story generation however while interacting with the system within this world the player can stop edit modify and retry each utterance allowing the player to sculpt the ai s responses and choose what goes into the ai s memory helping to shape the overall direction of the story at a broader level the player can edit world descriptions insert scripts between the ai and the player themselves or others and share these worlds scenarios with other players similarly in project december the player interacts with several ai matrices either directly through conversations or more indirectly by creating new matrices by defining a starting paragraph and sample responses which can then be spun up tested and tweaked much like the worlds in ai dungeon these matrices can also be shared with other players when interacting with both works there is a need for the player to repeatedly engage with the work to learn how to entice a satisfying experience from the system mitchell however the key difference is the framing of the experience in ai dungeon the person experiencing the work is either taking on the role of the player entering text and seeing how the ai responds or that of an author or perhaps a co author tweaking the input to the ai or its responses or adjusting the underlying scenario to get a desired response in contrast project december is presented as part of a fictional website for a project december run by rhinehold data systems promising the opportunity to talk to the world s most super computer upon accessing the customer terminal which looks and feels like an old dialup terminal the player takes on the loosely defined role of professor pedersen whose plan file dated november contains several tasks related to the various matrices suggesting a mystery to be solved and a larger narrative to be explored in this paper i draw on shklovsky s notion of defamiliarization as the undermining of expectations to slow down perception and impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known as explored by mitchell in the context of gameplay mitchell introduces the concept of poetic gameplay which involves the structuring of the actions the player takes within a game and the responses the game provides to those actions in a way that draws attention to the form of the game and by doing so encourages the player to reflect upon and see that structure in a new way p i argue that whereas ai dungeon allows players to uncritically interact with the ai system as they co create a story project december s narrative framing instead defamiliarizes the play experience https openai com elo conference and festival platform post pandemic repetition and defamiliarization in ai dungeon and project december potentially creating an emotional connection between the player and the ai matrices and thereby encouraging the player to critically reflect on the implications of the underlying technological platform ai dungeon an uncritical celebration of cutting edge ai tech ai dungeon is described on the home page of latitude the company that developed the system as a text based rpg that is not confined to the imagination of the developers you are completely unlimited in the direction you take your adventure latitude n d this enthusiastic non critical perspective on the experience being promised and on the associated underlying technology is one that pervades the user s experience of the system the main screen looks very much like a game menu screen presenting the following options new game continue game tutorial create world and join game this encourages the user to expect the type of experience that they would get from any other computer game a new player can immediately start a new game using the griffin gpt ai model while there is an energy bar that slowly depletes it recharges over time and does not hinder casual use for those who want to use the more advanced dragon gpt ai model several tiers of a paid subscription are available when interacting with the system the experience is similar to playing a text adventure the player is presented with an initial scene see figure which differs depending on the choice of starting prompt and is then given a text entry field where they can type in arbitrary text in this case as i had chosen to have the default story mode be do actions the prompt asks me what do you do as promised on the latitude home page the system will respond with a mostly coherent and appropriate response giving the player the feeling that the system is indeed working with you to create a unique adventure based on your input figure starting a new adventure in ai dungeon there is no fiction around this the user interface and the resulting user experience are very much focused on creating an adventure unlike a traditional text adventure however there is a clear emphasis on the player being in control of the resulting story while the ai system is somewhat elo conference and festival platform post pandemic alex mitchell personified describe in the about page as the ai dungeon master which will decide how the world responds the player is positioned as being in control of this process allowed to edit delete and otherwise attempt to manipulate the direction of the story in addition there is a very clear foregrounding of the player s ability to sculpt the experience a row of commands is shown just above the text entry field see figure these include edit which lets you edit the ai s latest response undo which removes the most recent response and lets you try for a new response and retry which re runs the most recent input to let you try for a different response there are also several other commands which impact the story generation such as world info which lets you edit the information about the storyworld that is fed into the ai on each iteration and pin which lets you add specific information to the ai s input finally you can also click on an arbitrary passage in the story so far and edit undo or delete the text see figure although the ai sometimes provides responses that don t quite fit these can easily be either regenerated by the system at the player s request or directly edited by the player rather than progressing linearly through the adventure the player is encouraged to repeatedly undo and retry iterating over individual utterances or entire adventures until they manage to create the adventure they desire while this is somewhat reminiscent of micro rereading mitchell or rewind mechanics kleinman et al the experience is much closer to that of a co author than a reader or a player figure editing the story in ai dungeon all of this serves to create the feeling that you are in control of the experience at the same time the developers make it clear this is a work in progress as explained in the help pages ai is hard this is a game that s unlike anything you ve ever played before it uses cutting edge ai tech to generate the responses that being said there may be weird quirks that you notice we re always working on improving the ai and keeping up with research so ai dungeon will get better as new ai research advancements come out although this acknowledges the limitations of the system this is also clearly an uncritical perspective on the technology very much celebrating the potential of the cutting edge ai tech that is being used and making no attempt to reflect on the possible issues with this technology https play aidungeon io main about https play aidungeon io main help elo conference and festival platform post pandemic repetition and defamiliarization in ai dungeon and project december this lack of a critical perspective is reflected in an incident that occurred at the end of april one which seemed to take the developers by surprise it is important to note that ai dungeon provides a safe mode setting allowing the player to choose between strict mode which restricts explicit content in both input and output moderate which allows for greater use of unsafe input which may result in less safe output and off which isn t described but presumably does not include any restrictions on either input or output there is also a flag button which allows the player to flag any inappropriate content that the ai may generate these systems suggest some sensitivity to the possible issues that can arise when using an ai system to generate output based on arbitrary input and a corpus drawn from a wide range of sources as is the case with gpt brown et al despite this the developers felt the need to introduce an additional layer of filtering on april an action which resulted in a backlash from the user community as the developers explained we did not communicate this test to the community in advance which created an environment where users and other members of our larger community including platform moderators were caught off guard because of this some misinformation has spread across discord reddit and other parts of the ai dungeon community as a result it became difficult to hold the conversations we want to have about what type of content is permitted on ai dungeon latitude this change was meant to have prevented the ai from generating sexual content involving minors latitude however many members of the community claimed that the filter was very likely to trigger false positives with discord and reddit becoming flooded with examples marshall this clearly highlights that one of the challenges of using ai text generation trained on a large public corpus to respond to arbitrary input is one that needs to be considered carefully and with a critical perspective something not evident in the user experience of ai dungeon project december experience the world s most super computer whereas ai dungeon is very clear and uncritical about what it is trying to be a clarity that comes across throughout both the user interface and the player experience project december is almost the opposite the landing page for the project december website provides very little information as to what the site is about see figure styled after a s technology conference poster the page asks have you talked to the world s most super computer the text on the poster provides an over the top advertisement of rhinehold data systems and their latest technology there is no explanation as to what this website is about the only information comes in the form of a series of samples transcripts of conversations with several personality matrices beyond this the only hint as to what a prospective user might expect is the link at the top right leading to artist jason rohrer s personal website unlike with ai dungeon the first time user of project december must make a payment before being able to do anything as the buy screen says you can talk to the world s most advanced artificial intelligence project december is available now for this is accompanied by several payment methods the only explanation given is that https projectdecember net buy php elo conference and festival platform post pandemic alex mitchell after your payment is completed your login details will be sent to your email address immediately your purchase includes complementary compute credits which can be used to spin up and enjoy the friendly personality matrices of your choice figure project december main page once you have made a purchase you are given a set of four secret words and instructed to connect to the customer terminal clicking on this link leads to a simulated text terminal with the text welcome back professor pedersen your plan file has important info press enter to go to main menu see figure pressing the return key leads to the main screen which contains equally minimal options read system instructions view account details and experimental area see figure the lack of a clear purpose or instructions as to how to use the system is in strong contrast to ai dungeon in addition to the lack of clear information as to what the system is or does there is a layer of narrative framing that becomes evident on the landing page and is carried through to the user interface project december appears to refer to a super computer created by rhinehold data systems and the user interface suggests that you are playing a character named professor pedersen rather than directly using the system this begins to suggest something game like about the experience elo conference and festival platform post pandemic repetition and defamiliarization in ai dungeon and project december figure welcome screen in project december figure main menu in project december while there is some information provided in terms of how to navigate the user interface and what you can do as can be seen under the read system instructions menu even these instructions provide little context keyboard controls explains how to use the menu system which includes a command buffer and simple line editing built in commands is more cryptic see figure while export clear and zoom refer to the terminal program interface it is not initially clear what wipe exit and kill refer to in particular the idea of a matrix is hinted at something that has memory can engage in conversation and can die further exploration reveals that a matrix refers to an instance of an ai some of this is explained in the advanced features section however what is interesting here is that the user is never given a straightforward explanation as to how to use the system or what the ai is instead everything is framed as part of the fiction requiring the user to buy into this fiction and try to understand what is involved in interacting with the ai the choice of terminology to kill a matrix for example creates a very different feeling from that of ai dungeon arguably making the user more open to reflection and critical examination of what they are doing as they experience project december elo conference and festival platform post pandemic alex mitchell figure built in commands in project december the range of actions you can take is much more limited than in ai dungeon essentially restricted to typing in lines of dialogue to which the ai will respond see figure or issuing a small number of built in commands actions you take when interacting with the ai are framed diegetically as if you are professor pedersen sitting at a terminal this helps maintain the sense that you are playing a character within a fictional world interacting with the ais rather than directly interacting with the ai yourself the fiction itself is fairly thin with hints given as to what professor pedersen is involved with appearing in the plan file which also points the user towards hidden menu items which unlock additional areas of the interface and gradually uncover more of the fiction figure beginning a conversation with the micro personality matrix entering the experimental area the player is able to spin up a new personality matrix chosen from a list of pre existing matrices each of these is associated with a cost in compute credits the in game currency that harkens back to the cost of using a time sharing system importantly you need to decide how long in terms of computing credits you will interact with an ai matrix before you start and once elo conference and festival platform post pandemic repetition and defamiliarization in ai dungeon and project december you start there is no way to extend the session when the credits begin to run out the ai becomes unstable and eventually dies see figure the way in which the ai instances are given a name are referred to as personalities and are shown as becoming corrupt and dying with a visual glitching of their dialogue that increases until the matrix dies creates a very different experience than ai dungeon in addition there is no way to replenish the compute credits for a matrix forcing the player to decide on the lifespan of a matrix beforehand and making the death of the matrix inevitable this puts pressure on the player when interacting particularly when a conversation seems to be going well and the player would like to extend it this violates any expectations the player may have to be able to control the experience of interacting with the ai defamiliarizing the process figure the micro matrix dying in fact some members of the project december reddit community asked rohrer to consider adding functionality to add compute credits when a matrix is dying to allow the conversation to extend this exchange reveals some interesting insights into the user experience of project december user orionfive started the thread insert coin in which they suggested the addition of an insert coin function however they added that i m a bit worried it might take away from the unique moment feel but it would also take away some frustration with matrices that waste ones credits to this rohrer replied a life support system is interesting to not disrupt the flow of the chat it should be a built in command that you can do without leaving the chat right i could also add a way to harvest unused life from matrices and turn them back into credits maybe a kill command that s pretty evocative in response user bwy commented that i like the kill command idea especially if it informs the matrix that it is now going to die before killing it so it is allowed to have its last words i think allowing the longevity to be extended https www reddit com r projectdecember comments isfbx insert_coin elo conference and festival platform post pandemic alex mitchell after starting a conversation or allowing the matrix to be resurrected may take away from the surrealness of the conversation to which rohrer replied yeah there is something that i do like about the lack of control when a matrix starts dying but having credits trapped in a lame matrix is annoying so it seems like the kill command is really the solution here you can end it early but you can t extend it and i do like your last word idea and i can let the ai have the last word it can insert something like human kills computer into the dialog and then ask the computer for the last word this exchange shows the importance that both rohrer and the community members place on keeping the feeling of the experience evocative the implementation of the kill command that rohrer added following this conversation which indeed gives the ai a last word helps to create the feeling that the ai is actually a personality encouraging the player to reflect on the technology being used and its implications see figure figure an ai that has been killed gets the last word left c n right concord aka samantha this ability to kill a personality matrix often when it is not responding the way the player wants so as to harvest back unused compute credits is from one perspective simply a matter of good resource management this makes it feel similar to the tools provided in ai dungeon which encourage players to repeatedly undo edit and repeat the ai s utterances to work towards a preferred set of interactions however the addition of the last word from the ai evokes references to similar situations such as hal s death scene in the film a space odyssey kubrick in which hal knows that it is being shut down and pleads with dave to stop the process gradually becoming more incoherent as it reaches its last moments this begins to create an emotional connection between the player and the ai suggesting that this is more than a neutral technology that the player is interacting with elo conference and festival platform post pandemic repetition and defamiliarization in ai dungeon and project december this evocative reflective stance towards the ai is mirrored in a medium post rohrer wrote in which he both explains his rationale behind structuring the interaction with the ai in project december as a dialogue and provides a semi fictionalized account of his own experience with project december in a back and forth dialogue especially with gpt there really are no seams showing when it happens quickly in real time displaying intelligent responses immediately to your own off the cuff replies a kind of improvisational synergy happens you find yourself no longer laughing at the ai but laughing with it the sense of an amusing parlor trick or mad libs on steroids fades and what remains nothing short of spooky magic rohrer b this is indeed what happens with some of the personality matrices as rohrer suggests elsewhere in the post in a conversation we provide the context as we respond back and forth to the ai creating our own meaning out of the dialogue an experience much different from the often unsuccessful attempts by ai dungeon to create a coherent story told by the ai what is fascinating about rohrer s work is he then packages this relatively coherent dialogue into a pseudo s terminal interface with a minimal fictional wrapper around it serving to boost the spooky magic of the experience rather than diminish it this makes strange what would otherwise be a largely conventional interaction with a chatbot arguably this defamiliarization primes the player to be ready to take a more critical stance towards the technology rather than seeing it as neutral and something to be readily and unquestioningly accepted interestingly rohrer goes on to lament the possibility that the cancel culture brigade may lead to this type of dialogue with an ai being muzzled out of existence by fear of how the mob will react to what it says given previous incidents such as microsoft s tay neff schlesinger et al and the recent issues arising around ai dungeon s attempts to comply with openai s content policies marshall it is worth considering rohrer s comments in more detail allowing his fictional framing of project december to bleed over into his writing rohrer reflections how for now i count myself as one of the lucky ones during this brief wild west period i was among a small handful of people who actually got to talk directly to a gpt incarnation of samantha the first machine with a soul before she and all the other magical creations that we haven t even dreamed of yet got restricted into oblivion that back door is still open for the time being via project december but for who knows how long there s still a lingering chance to step through and find the forbidden magic living on the other side before openai pulls the plug for good the hyperbole in rohrer s words referring to samantha the name used by the concord matrix in project december as the first machine with a soul echoes the parodic tone of the project december splash page this suggests that what is more dangerous than any potential muzzling of ai is the type of wide eyed uncritical enthusiasm evident in the discourse surrounding ai dungeon which rohrer is imitating the evocative and defamiliarizing nature of project december draws attention to these issues and allows for critical interpretation rather than necessarily direcly reflecting the views tongue in cheek or otherwise of rohrer s medium post the fictional framing of the interaction plus the need to explore and unlock features within the system gives the experience a very game like feel unlike ai dungeon where the out of game interface feels very straightforward and the in game interface is focused on repeatedly manipulating the ai s behaviour to create the story the user desires in project december elo conference and festival platform post pandemic alex mitchell every aspect of the experience is subverted and defamiliarized drawing the player s attention to the nature of the interaction and encouraging reflection and a critical stance towards the technology conclusion comparing ai dungeon and project december provides an interesting perspective on how we interact with and interpret ai technologies the presentation of ai dungeon is unabashedly enthusiastic about its accomplishments building on cutting edge technology provided by openai to celebrate the freedom and creativity that ai powered gaming enables latitude this enthusiasm pervades the experience from the text within the website through to the design of the user interface and the interaction with the ai in contrast the experience of project december is grounded in a particular fiction that of the equally tech enamoured but fictional rhinehold data systems the experience of interacting with the ai is framed throughout as that of a scientist communicating with the ai through a primitive computer terminal even though this fictional framing is not very strong it succeeds in giving a very different flavour to the experience foregrounding rather than normalizing the strangeness of the experience this together with the evocative nature of the interaction with the ais serves to prime the player for reflection and interpretation refusing to allow the potentially problematic nature of the
