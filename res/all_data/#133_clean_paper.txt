melinda m white elo platform post pandemic plat free forms accessible tools for new e lit composers in a participatory medium immersion implies learning to swim to do the things that the new environment makes possible janet murray hamlet on the holodeck for new digital swimmers or those just dipping their toes into the pool for a semester or two complicated and expensive technology and skill sets can sometimes hinder creative expression as davin heckman argues professors should work diligently to create places in the curriculum that can include electronic literature as a standalone subject or part of a dynamic portfolio of rhetorical computational and or aesthetic practices that make sense within a broader educational setting in addition to introducing students to electronic literature and multimodal writing my goal as a teacher of digital creative writing is to get students to listen to their broccoli follow their intuition as anne lamott suggests and express their unique voices through multiple modes as troy hicks expresses in crafting digital writing composing texts across media and genres i want to see our digital generation live up to their potential as conscientious citizens and creative producers of text in all forms sure they can post status updates quicker than most of us adults can pull out our phones yet inviting them to be intentional about the craft of digital writing is perhaps the best way to help them realize their potential in academic social political and community contexts when we talk and teach thoughtfully about the elements of digital writing words images sounds videos links and other media elements we are helping them be purposeful and in turn helping them be creative many assume that digital writing is natural for digital natives but this is often a new and sometimes intimidating way of writing for them by utilizing software that is accessible on their own computers and easy to navigate students are less intimidated free to create and focus on writing composing although all software has its limitations i m seeing some wonderfully creative and thoughtful projects from my students particularly during covid i find students are writing more about their identities mental health social justice issues and human connection my digital creative writing courses are all open education resource oer the hewlett foundation defines oer as teaching learning and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re purposing by others as quoted by bliss and smith oer isn t new it s been around for nearly years but it can be a challenge even in a digital course to find all the readings and materials available online or to post pdfs without copyright infringement in addition i have been working to find open source software for students to compose with in the past i white have relied heavily on the adobe creative suite in my courses which for my students is accessible and free on campus so i let it slide for the oer course because it s familiar to me provides a blank canvas for design and allows me to avoid teaching html coding i have mainly taught dreamweaver for hypertext projects i have also always tried to incorporate free software options twine google maps and knightlab storytelling tools but found myself expanding these options even more this past year with the spring pivot online adobe was not quite as easy to access although the free subscriptions they offered were appreciated by several of my students and students in the fall wanted to use their own computers and not those in the lab understandably between my writing and e lit courses we explored google earth scene and thinglink for work and relied mostly on twine and thinglink for hypertext projects maps introducing multimedia nonlinearity i have always used map essays in my introductory courses as they are a simple way to introduce nonlinear narratives and fragmentation the more straightforward interface allows students to open up to these concepts while still having control over the order of the narrative a perfect medium for place and travel writing with low stakes technology both google mymaps and knightlab s storymap are easy to use platforms for new composers and useful in introducing multimodal writing students often gravitate toward writing about places or trips that were meaningful to them from their childhood homes to how they move through the world students are often drawn to writing about their homes some literally write about their own backyards and some explore mapping journeys or a collection of significant moments that are tied to place since in this essay medium is also already chosen the subject matter is influenced by the affordances of the visual of the map they also put thought into the navigation some visual design whether or not to include pictures and or video and if so of what in lily pudlo s essay backyard adventure she writes about her childhood neighborhood through the lens of her child self adventure stories in a small landscape another student maya horton wrote about adventure trips a little farther off capturing meaningful outdoor trips in adventures in the northeast see fig that displayed personal growth and reflection in her introduction she states while i have grown and changed over the years nature was a constant in my life it was always there when i needed it it has been an escape from reality and a place where i could be my true self it has given me a reason to keep going it has literally given me a breath of fresh air when i was feeling stagnant and confined it has been a place where i could simply just relax and have fun it has put me in my place held me accountable helped me overcome my fears and allowed me to realize things about myself and others white figure adventures in the northeast by maya horton these essays fit with our discussion of creative travel writing which according to bradway and hesse has a strong narrative voice and a writer deeply and directly involved in the events of the place the narrator is usually going somewhere new a sense of adventuring into the unknown is nearly always the dominant tone often inflected by physical and or emotional risk bradway and hesse these essays all express something about their authors whether it is through childhood play or a travel adventure this semester marielle webster s storymap the year before the world ended recounts her last year of travel before the pandemic especially meaningful upon reflection see fig white figure screenshots from the year before the world ended by marielle webster white covid has played a big role in the past year of creative projects in my digital literature course in spring the pivot to online classes in march happened to correspond to the collaboration section of my digital literature course we read scott rettberg s electronic literature instead of doing collaborative projects together on campus i had to adapt that assignment and we used a collaborative google map see fig to map our location and how we were feeling about our new stay at home circumstances the creative writing students also wrote a collaborative map about what home means to them which would have been our in class free write figure socialdistancingcollaboration both map platforms have their limitations of course storymap is a very linear slideshow esque experience google maps is also fairly linear with points listed down the side and both are templated with limited design options once students have completed a map project they are often excited to expand their design autonomy and create something from the ground up twine has been a great option for final hypertext projects twine for representation and social commentary as twine author porpentine puts it twine simply exists and doesn t belong to anyone except everyone as quoted in rettberg i began using twine when i first made my introductory course oer although i had heard about twine in the e lit community and heard presentations on the representation it afforded for feminist mental health narratives and lgbtq stories and games i had not yet used it myself the limited need for straight up html coding is valuable for students who are only writing e lit for a semester in this way it s not unlike dreamweaver but with an interface that doesn t fully disguise html and css from the user by copying and pasting the code from the amazing twine wiki the students don t think of it as coding in the twine revolution began white it is a movement started by trans women and then was expanded to other queer identities as well arguably one of the most relevant resistance efforts in gaming kopas makes in her own words a bold statement about the matter hypertext and digital games are totally trans genres twine has presented itself as a platform that is very welcome to diverse narratives which challenge the default premises of game design even though twine games are primarily based on text there are plenty of ways in which twine can explore visuality and sound within its narratives the base html can be incremented with css and javascript elements so as long as web technology keeps being pushed forward twine will not become outdated it is a very interesting tool with numerous possibilities for the development of not only diverse stories but also new mechanics and logics to be incorporated within the textual narrative bragan√ßa mota fantini these factors have made twine an optimal platform for marginalized voices with games like zoe quinn s depression quest working to promote empathy for mental health and porpentine s with those we love alive working to further lgbtq representation as scott rettberg points out in chapter of electronic literature the twine community has also developed its own identity as a place of avant garde experimentation with language gender and identity twine is particularly popular with young authors who are arguably the first generation of digital natives this is electronic literature that emerged first not in online magazines academic gatherings festivals or online databases but instead on tumblr feeds for students it s proven an intuitive easy to learn platform for branching multimodal narratives i ve had several students write about their lgbtq identities or coming out stories often in video essays that have a more linear narrative but twine seems to be a natural platform for the expression of underrepresented identities and a medium in which students feel comfortable sharing their stories bridget widrig for instance wrote about her first pride experience with her girlfriend see fig with branching narratives she gave the reader the choice of where to go a cowgirl bar stonewall etc and who to meet next although each readthrough ended up in the same place with the first photo of the couple wrapped in a pride flag and as she says i felt so confident and content with who i am celebrating with the rest of the world how amazing it feels to be yourself i felt so lucky to be there white figure screenshots from pride by bridget widrig white i m also directing an honors thesis this semester and my student parker ayotte is writing a twine story that includes social justice issues such as racism and classism there is also a nonbinary character dealing with injustice and a second person player that is genderless unlike some second person narratives such as calvino s that gender the you as male as rettberg says while the underlying principles of twine are based on hypertext many twine games have also adopted conventions from interactive fiction such as the second person form of address to the player character spatial navigation through the narrative and a sparse economical style of writing this player character is also held accountable for their actions but most significantly their inaction or passivity when confronted with issues of racism and injustice the entire fiction ends in somewhat of a futile entropy where the reader player doesn t really make a difference in the system despite multiple possible endings for example in the on the fence ending it ll take a while but slowly you ll push for more and more change but is that the right thing to do sitting and silence and indirectly supporting the people you can t stand plus will your morals survive throughout the passing of decades that s up to you i have already made my decision on your fate by straddling the delicate line between hero and villain all you do is incriminate yourself additionally in the video for the perfection incarnate ending the voice over narration states acting as a face of peace and change in the middle of oppression and social control you will make a perfect member of satan s regime i now know who you are and you have been judged parker discusses in his analysis portion the usefulness of twine as a forum for representation and digital activism he chose the platform over dreamweaver despite some limitations for what he wanted to accomplish for the specific reason that it is more representational and embodies the social messages he s conveying in his story see fig white figure screen shots from promise of paradise by parker with reader name entry this is significant given current conversations in the elo around ways to increase representation and diversity because of its accessibility and ease of distribution twine has been an essential tool for not only disseminating but amplifying historically suppressed voices also turning up their collective volume through twine have been the neurotypical many students have been writing about mental health struggles in these platforms and i have found this ever increasing during the covid pandemic maya s twine project a mess of emotions white see fig for instance documents her daily struggles in a covid journal that takes us through her inner dilemmas struggles and experiences including contracting the virus along the way figure screenshots from a mess of emotions by maya horton and stuart moultrhop says of twine in his article hypertext fiction ever after as we hypertext authors once did twine writers want to do unlikely things with stories making the most of simple easily accessible technologies whether they acknowledge it or not they are agents of a vital digital literacy asserting word based text both in terms of prose and underlying code as the locus or seriously meaningful play beyond this as their enemies will say they have an white agenda setting out to defend the interests of women gay and transgender people the neuro atypical and others marginalized and excluded by the military infotainment complex they are discontented with an arrogant intolerant casually violent society and have set themselves against an entrenched culture industry they think of what they do as play as storytelling or as an occupation of gamespace they are carrying on a struggle hypertext fiction may never get out of the cloister but its younger cousins have found their way to the streets it will be interesting to see what the future of twine looks like what revolutionary texts will be rising from our young cousins in these tumultuous times i find it interesting that among other scholarly work i ve seen in twine including e lit analyses my student sabrina brown used this new platform to provide a historical overview of hypertext her scholarly project the world of electronic literature see fig provides information on the form including historical characters and genres based on our textbook rettberg s electronic literature figure screenshots from world of electronic literature by sabrina brown as mentioned earlier the basics of twine are straightforward but more advanced things like audio movement image maps etc are not always as intuitive for students my students have white managed video audio and some code tweaking but for things like image mapping i suggest students consider thinglink this platform is extremely user friendly and several of my students have used it to write about their identity and mental health thinglink a multimodal surprise the simplicity of both twine and thinglink for hypertext essays has allowed these new digital swimmers to delve deeper into the platforms potential and their subject matter i have been impressed with the complex projects being made in thinglink which at first glance seems like a very simple platform i should add that for what we want to accomplish it s not free but for a small fee a teacher can have an educational account with multiple seats and add more as needed it provides for inclusion of multiple modes you can embed or add links to video environments add sound videos and link multiple pages projects together my introductory level students have no trouble learning the interface and executing their ideas the ease of the platform interface allows students to focus on their creative expression as these are nonfiction courses often these projects are very personal and many students write about their struggles and experience with mental health liberty laarman in her essay my brain probably looks like a popcorn ceiling for instance created a simulacrum of her spotify playlist with stories behind each song including experiences with her therapist and dealing with the loss of a friend see fig white figure screenshots from my brain probably looks like a popcorn ceiling by liberty laarman since we read shelley jackson s my body a wunderkammer i also see many hypertexts with body or mind maps dealing with body image or mental health some examples include a map of someone s scatter brain showing her scattered nighttime thoughts and fears and this project brianna jones hands see fig that deals with self expression identity and human vulnerability white figure screenshots from hands by brianna jones the theme of the final project in the introductory course is connections which can mean many things my student samantha stewart really captured the idea of human interconnectedness in her essay sonder see fig sonder according to john koenig means the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own koenig sam captured this with a interactive image of a bustling time square where we can see people passing each other as strangers with text that promotes connectedness in the common human experience very relevant during the past pandemic year white figure screenshots from sonder by samantha stewart vr and other things thinglink allows links on videos and also has capabilities seen in the sonder piece as students move toward more immersive storytelling we have found accessible ways for them to compose virtual spaces such as through google earth and knightlab s scene with capable projects that can be read in google cardboard an affordable vr viewer we have in our lab google earth provides a similar interface to google mymaps with satellite views and the addition of street view capabilities utilizing the d option provides an immersive experience where readers can feel like they are exploring a place see fig the google white earth platform is still user friendly and students often use these projects to explore their homes or travels in one project a student explored multiple possible futures as they prepared to graduate in a pandemic to an uncertain future figure example map for digital literature view scene provides easy upload of panoramic or full images with added text for simple vr projects when we left campus last spring since we could no longer use the lab i adapted the vr unit and we explored these platforms mostly close to home including my front porch see fig i look forward to vr technology becoming more accessible in the future so students can explore more immersive creativity figure example scene from my front porch white of course there are other plat free forms out there these are just a few that we have explored in addition i have offered students the opportunity to remediate nick montfort s work taroko gorge trevor arseneau made gorge of anathema which conveyed some of the frustration at the beginning of our lockdown last spring see fig figure gorge of anathema by trevor arseneau this semester i m teaching an intermediate course and tried out knightlab s timeline an elegant tool for chronological projects although timeline was not as straightforward as the other knightlab software we ve used once students got past the learning curve and the excel spreadsheet interface the projects turned out quite well the spreadsheet makes it simple to add images media and text change font and background color etc a short publishing process consisting of copying the link to the timeline website provides a permanent url this is one of the great things about storymap and scene as well students do not have to worry about publishing to and maintaining their own domain space the projects are already hosted this project caroline goodwin s my year of covid a timeline see fig documents her experience during covid similar to a mess of emotions with news clips and personal stories including participation in a black lives matter protest students in this class are currently busy with meaningful and imaginative final projects in multiple platforms twine thinglink google earth and knightlab s storymap and scene as well as students in the introductory class composing the final connections projects in twine and thinglink white figure screenshots from my year of covid a timeline by caroline goodwin conclusion the simplicity of the software has allowed these new digital swimmers to delve deeper into the platforms potential and their subject matter daniel anderson discusses the benefits of introducing students to unfamiliar technologies in his article from a pedagogy of multiliteracies designing social futures engaging technical things comes with a bigger white payoff experimenting with unfamiliar technologies can facilitate a sense of creativity that can lead to motivation this is particularly significant in creative writing where exploring the creative affordances of the media seems to extend to the words the topics and the stories as themselves students learn technical skills as they compose often from each other digital platforms these unfamiliar technologies often take them out of their comfort zone which seems to spark more creativity thinking outside the norms of a print essay and a deeper and more thoughtful self expression they currently seem to be thinking and writing from a deeper social perspective too shining through the cracks caused by this time of upheaval intent on healing this broken society as davin heckman asks in his article inventing pedagogies for electronic literature can electronic literature open up a critical perspective on society during a period of radical historical upheaval let s hope so seeing playing participating in new immersive and mobile works from the national film board of canada like far away from far away bubble and motto and work like yesterday today and tomorrow and infinite worries bash in the fall issue of the new river journal that are collaborative voices political social and personal my students are feeling connected and a part of the current zeitgeist there is very much a feeling of we are all in this together the projects the students are composing what would be categorized as third generation e lit that builds upon existing forms and adopts existing interfaces flores are still bursting with originality and creativity perhaps the form even broadening the creative scope of their ideas these accessible platforms enable expression particularly of marginalized voices as twine has been used widely in the lgbtq community while also providing potential for exploring virtual spaces with minimal technology as anne frances wysocki says in writing new media when someone makes an object that is both separate from her but that shows how she can use the tools and materials of her time then she can see a possible self a self positioned and working within the wide material conditions of her world even shaping that world in that object these student projects show how less technical more accessible plat free forms can be used to create political diverse and deeply personal narratives allowing digital learners to shape their worlds and add their voices to the world of e lit white works cited anderson daniel the low bridge to high benefits entry level multimedia literacies and motivation multimodal composition a
