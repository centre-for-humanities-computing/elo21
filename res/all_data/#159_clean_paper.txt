gastropoetics by davin heckman may updated may abstract this paper will explore memmott and rettberg s gastropoetics as a humanistic challenge to the grammar of language platform and text generation the impulse is to situate such works within the tradition of dada and futurist performance where obvious antecedents can be found however in the age of platform dominance the meaning of experiments in absurdity and embodiment take on new meaning as platform spaces do the work of aestheticizing the absurd conditions produced by the taylorization of social life where industrial processes once disturbed the lifeworld of human craft and technique in the process of industrialization the cultural world at the most minute level is subject to the proletarianizing process and its reassembly into an economic model is now the work of the platform spaces in other words platforms do the ideological work of normalizing social collapse as progress towards the rationalized reorganization of body politic into taste communities and other post digital demographies while gastropoetics is a marginal practice these culinary experiments explore the relational dynamics of cooking hospitality and eating as persistent humanistic practices even as such practices are increasingly mediated by emergent practices like food selfies and other performative taste practices key to understanding the appeal of gastropoetics is the ad hoc nature of human production and consumption see de certeau s everyday life performed under the constraints of the generated menu of the platform and of the mnemotechnical system itself intro this paper will be my least paper like presentation to an elo conference in the past i felt the responsibility to treat my conference presentations like papers packing them with critical references and laboring to establish the illusion credibility against the reality of my own idiocy latin idiota ordinary person greek idios personal one s own but finds me totally defeated as a scholar instead of thinking i should labor in vain against the hegemony of media industries social networks and the inertia of clique bait not a typo i have decided at least for today to give up on scholarly writing instead i write a love letter stuffed into a bottle and tossed into the sea apologies for the accidental police reference in an effort to dispense with the formalities that i have grown accustomed to i will offer some ideas to frame what follows by pulling out key concepts from the abstract that i am obligated to fulfill futurist and dadaist antecedents f t marinetti s la cucina futurista barbara turner s artists and writers cookbook which feature s man ray s menu for a dadaist day salvador dali s les diners de gala are notable antecedents that foreground avant garde recipes rather than merely recipes by artists fluxus artist rikrit tiravanija has developed an entire body of work based around cooking and eating together literary references to food are intrinsically weird in that food itself is a richly affective cultural metaphor like music and other sensuous forms it is non representational whereas the modern literary arts are largely semiotic food is corporeal often sculptural and can be formed into symbolic objects though the physical form must be destroyed to be consumed and the primary sensual experience is non figural on the other hand foods can remind us of other tastes smells and feelings and their associated contexts it is the liminality of food transformed from living matter to a meal ingested in the passage from plate to body its symbolic character shifting from form to experience etc that make it an ideal subject for avant garde consideration i d argue that these same qualities make food a rather consistent ritual object in human history as well while there is a temptation in scholarly writing to create some lineage of influence i wish to argue that food has a primal resonance that precedes the pull of culture yes we can cultivate culinary practice and taste but in the end what s good is good and this goodness is singular changing from person to person from year to year from one moment to the next what one needs or what one has just tasted can determine what one wants next on the other hand food might ask us to consider whether or not conceptual work is avant garde at all it could be less about what happens next and more about what is not happening now at least this is the case with fluxus moreso than futurism and dada eating reminds us as latour likes to say that we have never been modern nor have we transcended it taylorization of social life frederick winslow taylor introduces scientific management to the process of human labor rather than working at holistically at craft production taylor argues labor should be streamlined to remove all unnecessary movements an engineer must examine all aspects of the production process reducing productivity to a series of iterable processes that can be broken apart rationalized and then reorganized to remove all unnecessary motions this innovation in addition to transforming the way human bodies labor makes automation simpler allowing greater coordination of the machine and human in the industrial assemblage at first blush the idea of social life might seem antithetical to such a process as the social carries connotations of informality and excess but as with all things it is possible to frame the sociopolitical as an assemblage of psychological and biological needs see biopolitics which can be streamlined and optimized through therapeutic interventions in this way various sensual experiences are essentialized as entertainment experiences that can be recorded formalized and transmitted via commercial media products movies games theme parks meals etc even fairly singular experiences like grief love despair seduction joy relaxation seek to be captured and transformed into various kinds of labor sex work emotional labor counseling self care etc under the microscope of social media even formerly idiosyncratic events like interpersonal conversation arguments condolences flirtations illness triumphs are placed under the panoptic gaze of data mining industries our every move analyzed and enhanced through predictive optimization customized reciprocity and further analysis the singular stuff of life that was once sheltered under the umbrella of political power has become the umbrella itself underneath it power is protected see neoliberalism and governmentality as a result nothing escapes the ever seeing eye of the automatic engineer the grammar of language and platform language which is a symbolic representation is subject to grammar historically many types of mimetic representation have escaped from the prescriptive character of grammaticization while descriptive grammar is considered as a less repressive approach to language than its prescriptive cousin it is merely a waystation on the road to grammatizing everyday life which heretofore had been largely resistant to normalization while human behavior is loosely organized by norms and expectations social life tends to reward deviation and surprise in inverse proportion to the degree to which normative expectations dominate in other words manners and customs enable tactical play and these subversions are the spice of life however the advent of digital platforms as spaces for everyday life present a challenge to these kinds of tactical subversions the common notion that if you can think of it you can find it on the internet is more of a curse than a blessing those who are obsessed with normality have no trouble finding it those of us and we all do so in our own ways who struggle against conformity must now drive further to find it this might create some interesting possibilities for subculture but it has a way of accelerating anti social tendencies by requiring more from would be deviants than they would otherwise require in a metastable locality the coupling of extreme normativity with ever radicalizing notions of resistance provides excellent fodder for machine learning while wreaking havoc on livable communities platforms have accelerated conflict and while strip mining the pleasure of the everyday aestheticizing politics we often think of the aestheticization of politics in relation to the way in which fascist regimes wrap themselves in aesthetic packaging to fabricate a picture of social unity to this benjamin introduces an oppositional tendency the politicization of art debord does a better job in the society of the spectacle by pointing to the collective formation itself as that which has been aestheticized in other words the masses themselves cease to be political in the sense that they are no longer a site of conflict in which the actions of the state are produced instead the masses exist as a proxy for the expression of the will of the state they are a spectacular form used to legitimate the actions of power rather than the participants in a more arendtian vision of the public sphere in which the demos negotiates the production of power this distinction works very well with the contemporary american conception of politics two parties representing competing styles of governance with policy produced by leadership mediated through the elite pluralist model here politics is something we subscribe to like netflix streaming into our lives without access to the means of its production though we are told that in subscribing and selecting with streams to view we provide the necessary input for the creation of the content we wish to access in this respect our political system is thoroughly aestheticized following the advent of social media where a tight feedback loop is created between the public sphere as an object of consumption thus when we think of the aestheticization of politics we might do well to go deeper than the casual understanding of american electoral politics and even benjamin s prescient discussion in the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction stiegler s notion of adoption which is discussed in symbolic misery performs the necessary reframing of this question in the contemporary moment it is the public itself that has become aestheticized and thus politics along with it a process which may not be possible without the enormous apparatus of social networks which make the surveillance organization and grammaticization of the everyday possible downstream from this we see the pathological performances of symbolic misery itself as the political gesture par excellence of american consciousness the collapse of community the thorough commodification of the self the fungibility of everything punctuated by desperate attempts to reclaim the singularity through ever broadening regimes of sousveillance through hyperbolic performances of affect through customized modifications of a self that we no longer believe in through competitive taste cultures through works of art entangled in absurd cryptographic schemes etc in other words platforms do the ideological work of normalizing social collapse as progress towards the rationalized reorganization of body politic into taste communities and other post digital demographies this is the upheaval phase of what the davos crowd calls the fourth industrial revolution and the proletarianization process proceeds with culture as its terrain your hopes and dreams are tropes and memes gastropoetics in spite of the great wave of rationalism that we are living through there are plenty of moments and places where people still live human lives even in amazon warehouses and the new plantations of global manufacturing people continue to live in spite of the totalizing aspirations of their expert managers and their machine intelligence people still break laws violate norms and flout received opinions so the situation is not hopeless for though there are traitors who are seduced into imitating the logic of surveillance and control typically who imagine that they will share in the monitoring and administration of order and that compliance will protect them from their own deficiencies the nature of such a control society is not to eliminate pirates rather it is to make pirates of us all if the panoptic gaze teaches us the virtue of self regulation at the service of the cop in the tower then the extrapolation of panopticism towards a universal accountability to the massive digital apparatus also places us all in a universal default the always on eternally archived pseudo omniscience of the network makes us all vulnerable to it not necessarily for what it knows but for what it claims to know and every bit of ourselves we obscure or reserve is a crime against the empire we are all guilty we are all fugitives from the law we are all pirates the choice we face each day is whether to become privateers or be free the sooner we accept this is the ethical terrain of the st century the sooner we reclaim our vita activa from the prescribed performative pseudopopulism of platform spaces the aporia in meaning is not an artifact of language belched into existence by grammatical dysfunction it is not an engineering problem to be solved by a sociopathic wunderkind with a quantum computer it is your différance which makes a difference and so the emerging control society forces us to take sides do we anoint ourselves with the authority of illegitimate power and use our vulnerability to negotiate a decoding strategy that papers over its brutal errors or do we live lives of lawless imagination in a constant state of dissemblance against our own aestheticization the aporia is in your belly eater response theory gastropoetics is not the last pirate ship sailing the seas of consciousness i only wish to hold it up as one practice that does something difficult but necessary something between a moveable feast and a last meal that defers definition and achieves a kind of poetic resistance to the rapacious instrumental drive of platform spaces while gastropoetics is a marginal practice these culinary experiments explore the relational dynamics of cooking hospitality and eating as persistent humanistic practices even as such practices are increasingly mediated by emergent practices like food selfies and other performative taste practices instead this is a call for a hundred thousand billion such marginal practices with many more being hatched in the imagination such a world is closer than we think as this practice is already in progress the only thing it lacks is our will to think it the possible world is not one we are burdened with bringing into being the possible world is the unrealized world that we desire key to understanding the appeal of gastropoetics is the ad hoc nature of human production and consumption see de certeau s everyday life performed under the constraints of the generated menu of the platform and of the mnemotechnical system itself over the past few years i have been lucky to be a guest talan memmott s test kitchen for the limerick diet in march joined by guest diners carrie heckman and joseph tabbi and quarantine quatrains at elo and while these events are documented and it is possible to replay these events in various capacities memmott and rettberg s the limerick diet was performed on july at the elo conference in cork ireland randomly selected guests were invited to sit for an evening of dinner and drinks at an off site house while the audience watched via livestream the instigating element of the event is the text generated menu http retts net limerickdiet go html for those who wish to look at the constituent parts of the text generator that can be most easily found here http retts net limerickdiet the specific menus from the july event are published on the gastropoetics facebook site https www facebook com permalink php story_fbid id at this point we can marvel at the skill with which the javascript generators that combine ingredients culinary techniques and thematic elements to create limericks which function as menu items for the guests complicating things a bit are the local seasonal thematic and technical constraints that undoubtedly informed the content of the arrays as whatever is generated must in turn be prepared by memmott and rettberg furthermore there is also the hope that the combinations also provide pleasure to the guests hence the writing programming task of building a text generator like this requires an attention to what will ultimately be possible and more importantly to what will be good as is the case for much of electronic literature the outcome for this project is not a static published text but further than that there is no artifact that encapsulates the work either in the case of a work like montfort and strickland s sea and spar between the work contains a staggering array of possible reading experiences but all exist as a finite and quite specifically coordinated range of combinations that are bound within the artifact that is the code base similarly the initial iteration of montfort s taroko gorge while it builds stanzas randomly in real time as the work runs in your browser is also a bounded object whose entirety can be understood by examining its code or can it a work like taroko gorge as elegant as it is as a standalone work has achieved widespread attention thanks to the wave of remixes that it has inspired the ever growing list includes works of varied quality some of which could stand alone as unique achievements but all of which are enriched through the discursive space opened up by the originating work this highlights an interesting fact of the literary while professors and their students are often trained to collect works of art as artifacts to be subjected to a hermeneutic process the pleasure of the literary contains its own gratifications and while i am not going to provide a complete taxonomy of these gratifications i will describe a particular kind of gratification that this work illustrates that of an instigating moment for many readers a work like taroko gorge initiates a process of decoding translation and experimentation the pleasure such an experience provides can be as simple as a moment of realization when one peers at the source code and understands the ingredients to the recipe when one analyzes competing versions and enjoys the detournements of the text when one copies the work into a text editor and creates a new page that runs from their desktop when one creates a semantic system that works with montfort s engine when one creates a compelling text generator of their own and or when one enters into a community with other hijackers josé aburto s grita which requires readers to scream the poem into their browser judd morrissey s lament which is a live performance informed by a generated substrate or alis s typomatic which is platform that creates visual poems using words furnished by guests are just a few works that are best understood as machines created to initiate processes viewed in this context memmott and rettberg s experiments in gastropoetics represent an extended instance of literature as an instigating process rather than a bound text that itself is a performance of distinction as erudition the extreme example being something like norton anthology instead of adding a dead text to one s cultural repertoire as we do when preparing for exams or cultivating a social media profile a gastropoetic menu is a pinpoint on a long arc of practice preceded by countless hours of noodling in the kitchen tasting sipping giving receiving hacking and repeating the menu is succeeded by a meandering evening beginning with a game by which the guests create and name a cocktail from randomly selected cards continuing with chefs in the kitchen guests at the table beverages and plates passing in and out of spaces dynamic conversations the meal itself is the scaffolding for an elaborate and unpredictable social interaction while i did not dine at the july limerick diet i only tuned in and out of the video stream the march test kitchen at memmott s home offered an opportunity to experience the experience more fully joined by carrie heckman and joe tabbi memmott invited us to sit for an evening of machine generated meals we begin the evening with a card game and though i do not remember all the particulars i felt fairly lucky to be dealt a hand of cards which i parlayed into something called cayley s regret a kind of modified mesoamerican manhattan made from mezcal sweet vermouth a splash of bitters and black pepper with maraschino cherries talan on the other hand enjoyed the now infamous patchwork mule whiskey and sweet vermouth garnished with black pepper and sardine coated in candy sprinkles aided by a bit of alcohol the evening progressed via the following menu the winona test

mushrooms whizbang and zoom zoom oh the beef is fantastic in cork dublin beef de rigeur there is a beef dish known in dublin pan roasted with au jus is quite humblin so many hot peppers spliced in like striped zebras oh the onions and cinnamon of dublin i remember my meal kilkenny prawn anthropocene and the cork beef napoleon but more importantly i remember the evening as if through my own eyes as it pertains to the specifics of the meal i remember being excited and curious to see how the meal would progress from menu to table joe had made a trip to winona to visit in advance of an international move to bergen norway talan had offered up the opportunity of an experimental meal and invited carrie to join us but we all knew that we were being treated to test run of a project that had been in the works for months so we sat down at the table dealt us the cards with which we played out our cocktails the winner would select the first machine generated menu and so the evening began a menu exists as a kind of contractual space between which a restaurant and a diner agree upon a set of expectations the kitchen agrees to provide what is described on the menu and the diner agrees to pay for this meal in between there is the work of preparation and consumption both of which exist beyond the instrumental contractual obligation between the two parties here the chef has knowledge skill and varying degrees of latitude to interpret the meal as it is prepared the guest has expectations and tastes that ultimately test the activity of the chef apart from the agreement the experience is a social interaction mediated by service ambience conviviality at table and the meal itself in this the guest and chef play their part but there are many variables at play in a perfect world meals provide the pretext for a kind of radical hospitality and conviviality however we are also accustomed to purely instrumental and industrialized forms of eating famine and hunger at one end dictate a purely expedient form of eating in which getting food into an empty belly takes priority over all other considerations similarly cultures of efficiency provide us with constrained moments of consumption the grab and go meal the fastfood kitchen convenience cooking all of which provide a kind of relief from stress and mark a kind of material abundance that masks a kind of spiritual poverty at the core of prosperous societies finally there is a kind of pathological eating which can be excessive or constrained that provides a kind hypernourishment or hyponourishment which is characterized by a kind of carelessness when i say carelessness i do not mean to say that the act itself is entirely devoid of care indeed many kinds of careless activities are driven by an excess of a kind of care at the expense of another for instance neoliberal rhetorics of self care co opt the necessary affirmations of desire that encourage the improverished or enfeebled to access sustenance that is routinely denied to the underclass by puritanical cultures nevertheless such discourses have been adopted to rationalize a host of indulgences within privileged social segments as a form of moral preening meant to mask basic hedonic drives there is nothing wrong with pursuing pleasure in many cases but there is something uniquely perverse to appropriate the suffering of others to legitimate indulgence as it reaffirms the notion that one must enjoy oneself only with permission to do so and in neoliberal society this kind of self care exists alongside a corresponding discourse about transactionalizing hedonic interactions which has the ironic effect of further stigmatizing working class pleasure by claiming self care for those who can afford it and marginalizing free and collaborative conviviality as a source of restoration without getting lost in close reading there are larger observations about the experience of the limerick diet the first is an appreciation for the challenge that exists at the heart of the project the chefs set out a kind challenge for themselves that they must meet in the context of a live performance for real guests while the stakes might not be life or death success or failure are real possibilities as the guests may not enjoy the meal on the other hand the guests are caught up in the fun of witnessing the chef s challenge making the gastropoetic experience a game about making do about the triumph of skill over uncertainty and a significant portion of the time of waiting at the table concerned with seeing what will happen too often we tend to eat without thinking reserving this kind of anticipation for special occasions and even then probably spending less time wondering what our meal will be like the spectacle of human vs machine is significant here and the skill of execution rests heavily on the shoulders of the chefs as the techniques ingredients tastes and skills all present meaningful constraints on execution the quarantine quatrains which was based on a remote event in which viewers were invited to participate from home using ingredients on hand tested this dimension of gastropoetics further now it is possible of course that in the future machine generated menus will become a commonplace in fastfood kitchens similarly directly machine generated foodstuffs may attempt to obviate chefs altogether as it is the taco bell menu is a permutational project that creates novel menu items based on a fairly constrained pantry of items and burger king has already begun exploring the possibility of using ai to generate orders for identifiable customers as a scholar of digital and mass media i fully expect that it is inevitable that some will declare the machine generated meal delivered without human contact to be equal to or better than any human culinary accomplishment we are cursed with a twofold tendency to embrace a kind of pseudopopulism that declares all mass market commodities to be of superlative aesthetic merit on account of their market share millions of fans can t be wrong and to embrace a posthuman attitude towards intelligence which prefers technological achievement over human handiwork or reserves the enjoyment of the hand made as a kind of artisanal excess for elite consumers in the end who am i to say that ai generated music or art or food is better than what i can make with my own hands who do you trust a capricious idiot using cultural concepts inherited from geriatric nobodies or a multibillion dollar corporation with supercomputers a massive surveillance database and an army of engineers we know the answer to that question because we answer it every day when we privilege platform capitalism over people so these kinds of procedural experiments that employ machine processes to initiate human fecundity are critical to life in the st century or the signatories of ars industrialis manifesto declare we must struggle against carelessness incurie against the destruction of attention the latin root cura gives us our words care concern healing curing and curiosity and where we cease to attend to the value of human consciousness we resign ourselves to inhuman existence in thinking of the literary as something akin to eating a meal something we do with others that is nourishing and transient that cannot be easily written down that negotiates a variety of constraints abilities and desires in a moment of conviviality we reclaim the popular from the mass we take back this notion of popular as something we participate in as something that belongs to the common people and to common experience that can be at once commonplace and singular rather than something we merely consume a mass commodity or a platform that is packaged in a prescribed affective relation i am not confident that we will win by we i am not talking about the leadership class i am talking about everyone else it is always possible and increasingly likely that we will be overtaken by machine intelligence not because it will serve us perfectly but it might be decided that such intelligence adequate for our needs nor do i think that a kooky machine generated poetic menu prepared by a friend for the enjoyment of a small group of people will alter the course of human history rather i think billions of such practices must occur as they surely do and that we must be here as scholars to receive those paradigital occasions with an emphasis and curiosity about their social dimensions against the relentless prioritization of the machine processes that may or may not provoke them references arendt hannah the human condition university of chicago press ars industrialis manifesto http arsindustrialis org manifesto benjamin walter the work of art in the age
