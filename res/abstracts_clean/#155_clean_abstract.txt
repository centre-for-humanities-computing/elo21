 this submission to the elo conference and media arts festival is both a virtual engagement event a submission of a novel work of electronic literature for the platforming utopias and platformed dystopias exhibition and lastly an introductory performance proposed as a way of setting the aarhus vibe of the conference aarhus urban operating system aauos both is a piece that meditates the generational conflicts of e lit by situating e literary encounters with aarhus that invites for a virtual dérive of a platformed imaginary of the city this year s elo conference takes place online across a number of global partner institutions and will be hosted in aarhus which is to say at aarhus university s server instead of visiting the city of aarhus physically participants in this year s conference will visit the rather unspectacular platform conferences au dk which apart from the name and logo has little to do with neither the physical actualities of aarhus as a place nor the creative literary and intellectual qualities of aarhus as a space this virtual engagement proposal seeks to situate an e literary encounter with aarhus that exists at the intersection of the elo conference and its participants corporate visons for city development in aarhus and a chatterbot esque interface aesthetic that is connected to a generative neural network based bot by situating a parasitic interface based on the official elo conference website aauos enacts the flipside of the glossy corporate esque images and videos of aarhus offered by the university management see attachment for a sketch of the work in danish the work itself will be in english in this way aauos is both a case of rd gen e lit existing within the framework of an established platform and at the same time aauos is a handcrafted specifically designed system that can be associated with the nd gen of e lit entering into this position of tension between the generations of e lit elo the work invites for contemplation of the role of e lit in the face of the increasing platformization and zoomification of society on this flipside of the conference website participants are invited to interact with and mimic a neural network that was trained on corporate visions for so called creative city development which is really just a fetish relation to words such as concrete and building by creating an interface that connects these generative corporate visions and city imaginaries with a virtual conference on electronic literature aauos sustains an e literary encounter with emergent imaginaries of aarhus stemming collaboratively from local city developers a machine learning algorithm playful imitative writing practices and an international community of scholars in the case of aauos the work makes for an unstable and emergent poiesis of a gathering that could have been situated in the imaginary of an aarhus that might still become further aauos acts as an interface to a platformed vision for aarhus not quite a traditional situationist dérive of the city but something that might become an opportunity to perform an electronic dérive of the city s platformization
