 this paper will focus on ambient literature abba dovey pullinger as a kind of tradition inspired literature of the future thus i will propose to look critically at traditional theoretical concepts and devices and analyse how apply them to characterise and realise such reading experiences my starting point will be enhancing the concept of interactional metalepsis bell or bell ensslin and rustad then i will go for proposing the concept of embedded dramatic monologue a form of narration built upon tradition and useful in creating immersive ambient reading experiences i will focus on texts that declare dear reader borrow me your body and then i will show you my story thus i will analyse works for which the corporeal readiness gadd is conditio sine qua non of reading due to the fact that the reader s body is conceptualised as an essential element of the author reader contract such reading experiences frequently lead to mashing of ontological boundaries to entering extradiegetic elements into diegetic world or the other way round the phenomenon known as a metalepsis although theoretical approach to metalepsis had just been amplified in the digital fiction context because the interactivity has opened new fields for artistic exploration of this device ambient literature encourages deepening that critical reflection the concept of interactional metalepsis yet proposed still underlies the metaphorical and symbolic dimension of the reader entering into the storyworld while examples of ambient literature permit talk about literal overlapping of fictional and real world however such crossing of ontological borders results in a clear need of creating a space for a reader in the narration narrative and storyworld i will focus on the ways and devices used to achieve that being extremely interested in the form of narration that creates such space for a reader inviting him to cross the ontological borders i will propose to look back at the traditional form of dramatic monologue used for the first time by a camus in the fall in context of ambient literature we frequently can and should enhance the dramatic monologue s theory successfully built by i e m głowiński głowiński and talk about embedded dramatic monologue the latter build upon the interactional metalepsis and a bleed of the storyworld into the real world of the reader and vice versa does not simply simulate that in a storyworld there is a space for the reader who is listening to the protagonist s monologue it really invites the reader to be and act in the storyworld the storyworld that overlaps the reader s reality ambient literature often takes the form of narration that does not pretend to permit the reader to listen to the story protagonists as if he was standing close to them but demands that the reader really stand there elo classical locative narratives even gps less ones as janet cardiff s her long black hair and examples from works created on creative writing courses held at the university of lodz will be case studies used to illustrate characterised form
