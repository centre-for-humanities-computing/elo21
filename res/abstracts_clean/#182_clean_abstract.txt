 i propose comparing methods of generating forensic images of inch floppy disks in order to evaluate methodologies for use in media archeology labs many key works of electronic literature including the bulk of eastgate systems inc early publications were released on inch floppy media i will use both kyroflux and superdrive floppy disk controller units to generate forensic images and also generate images using bitcurator suite of forensic software and using legacy computing hardware and software gathering data on the quality of images created by these disparate methods and also on the workflows involved and the ease and practicality of employing them will produce useful information for other media archeology labs examining how the field of floppy disk forensics has advanced the results of these tests should show useful comparison data between the quality of the images created from identical media the range of image types that can be created using each technique and the usefulness for online access and emulation each forensic methodology and platform provides
