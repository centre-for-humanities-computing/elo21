 in electronic writing what often becomes more essential than the narrative is how the computational elements are brought into the fold of storytelling with the text at its centre heckman and o sullivan it is true but not uniform across all spaces of creative production collaborative efforts like we are angry experience have been very successful in using the online space to deliver a powerful message but in a space like india the digital divide also dictates the mode of storytelling especially when it comes to solo ventures when we think about indian online narratives the most common instances reach us via social media shanmugapriya and menon despite its reach the extent of experimentation is rather low that is why much of the writing can also be found on blogs hosted by websites like wordpress or blogger yet from personal experience of online writing as most of the readership is found on mobile phones the amount of media that can be incorporated is also limited it is limited because in a space like india many people still do not have access to a standard internet connection to view the multimodal elements my paper proposes to address how individual storytellers i e the people who write design and publish narratives all by themselves without any collective or institutional support who are forced to be minimal go about telling stories in the online mode my central research questions would be to understand the markers of indian ness if any will vary from a case to case basis as it is impossible to reduce a culture to certain markers in the narratives the socio cultural background of people who are telling these stories the platforms they are choosing to tell these stories to gather the data i intend to float a short survey in various research and writing communities and use the dra ft future of text dra_ft_ instagram photos and videos archive to develop my hypothesis via analysis i hope to understand the type mode and platform s most accessible for storytelling in the indian online space
