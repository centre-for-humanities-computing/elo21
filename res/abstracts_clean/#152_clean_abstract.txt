 a perennial question in the field of artificial intelligence is can a computer write poetry with the recent arrival of large pre trained language models such as bert and gpt n it s possible that the answer to this question in the popular imagination might soon be yes of course in this paper i argue that poetry is in fact the only kind of writing that language models can produce drawing on austen s how to do things with words i argue that language model outputs fail the necessary preconditions of felicitous speech acts rendering them hollow and void a phrase that austen also used to describe the illocutionary effect of poetry because of this i argue that language model outputs are always in accordance with william carlos williams definition of poetry in spring and all new form dealt with as a reality in itself regardless of the genre of text that the language model is trained to produce and the qualities of verisimilitude demonstrated by the model s outputs the paper concludes with a discussion frank lantz immersion fallacy arguing that even in a world with perfect language models that produce outputs indistinguishable from poetry composed by conventional means the poet would still be tasked with inventing new poetic forms the paper includes a discussion of critical responses to recent elo high profile experiments in language model generated poetry including gwern s gpt experiments david jhave johnston s rerites and lillian yvonne bertram s travesty generator and also explains the inner workings of language models and their history in computational creative writing
