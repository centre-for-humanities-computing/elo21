 the paper is devoted to the reading and critical reflection of the generated electronic literary texts from the structural point of view all textones of generated texts can be divided into standard schemes or patterns word combinations or the whole sentences that are switched according to the software algorithms authors use these schemes to make generated texts close to the natural human language if we look closer for example at elit twitter bots most of their twits look like meaningful expressions but what makes them meaningful and what kind of meaning can readers get from these patterns is it elo possible to catch the esthetic idea of the whole generated work analyzing these verbal patterns one of the strategies to reveal the author s aesthetic concept of the generated work is to identify the key words grid of the separate textone as well as of the whole work the key words grid allows to catch the thematic dominant and then move to the interpretive strategies of the whole literary work for example the sea and spar between by n montfort s strickland contains the following verbal patterns noun noun less verb past simple verb past simple noun nailed to the noun and how to withstand the jay pink course nailed to the noun object verb preposition on noun noun the refrains in these verbal patterns signify the thematic grid of the work the lexemes that form the thematic grid include groups of nouns with the meaning of a large space e g time sky eternity the second group includes both nouns and verbs with the semantics of space restriction e g coffin nailed to the third group is formed by predicates with the meaning of an incentive to an action aimed at getting out of a closed space e g wheel on plunge on loop on the first two lines in the first scheme contain calls for action directed outside e g costumeless turn and climb the lines in the second scheme implement the semantics of attachment inability to leave a particular place e g nailed to a coffin to my mind these verbal patterns correlate with an idea of contrast in general the vast space it is compared in the work with the infinity of the sea sky the virtual space of the www is contrasted with the isolation of a particular person interpretive tactic in this case is like the haiku interpretation when the first line is used as a keyword a seasonal word in haiku the next two lines are deployed within a single sentence the last line is a metaphor the textones generated in sea and spar between are easy to be structured that allows readers to identify the set of meanings the readers involvement in the interpretational process is one of the immutable conditions of electronic generative art
