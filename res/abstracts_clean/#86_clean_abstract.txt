 the contemporary digital environment is made possible through a matrix of behemoth infrastructures that traverse the orbital atmospheric oceanic and terrestrial domains these infrastructures manifest not only in the narrowly technical sense but encompass the manufacturing chains regulatory interfaces and geopolitical contexts that enable or forestall the development deployment and maintenance of digital systems at a global scale underpinning all these aspects are the flows of energy and materials constituting the liveable earthly ecology the latter comprises the ultimate baseline platform on which specific digital platforms as more commonly expressed are enabled but which being so defined can obscure these far larger structures and processes in which they are embedded coming out of all this we can note that the global scale of digital infrastructure is now foundational to the charting and modelling of a rapidly deteriorating planetary ecology but this comes with the recognition that the former is both the product and a critical facilitator of economic processes that are driving the very pollution wastage and largely unhindered exploitation behind our present environmental calamities it is in these contexts that we are encouraged to evaluate how works of digital art and electronic literature are responding to this uncomfortable paradox we might recall here how early digital art sought to demonstrate with admittedly varying success different possibilities for computing beyond militarised technoscience and the creative and critical challenge today is to rework and reframe digital platforms so they might perform and inspire substantive ecological critique and expression rather than be relegated only as perpetuators of extractive accelerationist technocentric paradigms contemporary electronic literature in its very particular fusions of data writing and the algorithmic affords rich experimental elo pathways for just this kind of work as deftly illustrated by the recent outputs of artists such as j r carpenter and eugenio tisselli this paper will contextualise and document the author s latest experiments with creating electronic literary works that bring together a diverse unconventional assemblage of platforms as a key aspect of their creation and expression cameras satellites drones canvas graphics esoteric code and printed outputs are combined to establish elaborate contingent exchanges with the work itself being enacted across these different platforms each contributing to an always provisional outcome and drawing its creative and critical force as much by examining and reflecting on these aspects and processes as the varied marks they leave behind in particular the author will discuss his newly emerging work landform in which satellite and drone image data of terrestrial landscapes are parsed into esoteric visual algorithms that once interpreted are compiled into code poems that draw on a vocabulary derived from scientific scholarly and poetic texts discussing present ecological concerns the aim is to actualise a set of speculative experimental relations between the platforms materials and concepts involved investigating their potential for enacting novel modes of environmental computational practice and thus suggest another vector for articulating the entanglements and contingencies that are driving the present situation
