 last year was the year of the shift from a physical environment to the multiplicity of online space space that operates on a different logic and it is measured by and clicks not metric system one image posted online no longer raises a question if it s good or bad but how it is growing with likes while our digital avatars are categorizing them with hashtags the online environment has no distinction between appearance and essence the appearance is the essence computers deal in symbol strings propositions algorithms and sentences but the view that their primary role to represent is limited spaces object and people in the computer database are represented through number modelling visualisation charts or simulation but these representations are not a real nature of computer operations constantly being rewritten and running complex task code is connected to repetition that leads to creating a sensation algorithmic instructions are using the logic of patterns to create rhythm and execute tasks that are multiplying and becoming rhythms again the year was the year we will remember as an event of a global pandemic that shifted the world into the environment of network a new realm of sense where background processes of code produce new expression and experiences it makes us ask questions what it means to exist as a digital avatar living exists in a webwork of entanglements and attachments webwork that is in a continuous change with elements of disruptions materialized in the environment as we communicate through different online video and conference platforms we are no longer bounded by physical space and time as laws of newtonian physics do not apply in a new realm of a networked environment algorithmic processes are reshaping physical environment and our senses what it means to be human in a networked environment how does it feel to say goodbye to the loved ones through a device that is using a video platform what kind of relationship will emerge with technology and inner apparatus within us instead of drawing conclusions and fixating on damage i am looking for a new method and a different perspective on how to live as a network being elo phenomenology as a study of experience provides the theoretical starting point for this paper as it allows us to inquire about the experiences of code in terms of an encounter this paper is approaching web network as a sensual entity with the autonomy of its own that offers a new realm of being
