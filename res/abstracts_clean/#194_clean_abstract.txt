 blaseball a fantasy baseball simulator developed by the game band took by storm quickly developing from a niche web game to an legitimate cultural phenomenon including a whole catalogue of fan created merchandise more than a dozen albums of music including a musical and a dedicated following of players from around the world much of the attraction of the game comes from the passionate involvement of the fans and the openness the game band have shown to players making the game their own in this paper i demonstrate how the game band and players make use of the affordances of web browsers as a platform to create an inclusive space for play where each player can enjoy the game in their own way without precluding or diminishing other ways of playing blaseball the specific examples i examine are the use of a minimalist text forward approach to the game in a way that gives players licence to imagine a diverse inclusive league of blaseball characters the development of forbidden knowledge as a way to include players with an interest in spoilers without alienating those who wish to avoid this information and the player led creation of a wiki that supports simultaneous yet mutually exclusive descriptions of characters and events in the game which allows the community of fans to enjoy a variety of interpretations of the minimalist events of the game without excluding any other faction of the fanbase elo in using a minimalist text forward approach to game development the game band not only created a low cost quick to iterate game by excluding the time and labour intensive components of visual art video and audio elements they also created an opportunity for fans to develop their own visions of the in game characters and events without being limited by canonical race gender or sexual orientation this seemingly practical choice for a project from a small team is in fact pivotal to the game s inclusiveness given the easy access to the game s code that web browsers offer it was inevitable that players would explore and try to divine how the game works while such behaviour could be seen as cheating in blaseball the interaction with the game s code and data is part of the experience in response to the grey area such interactions exist in the game band and players developed the idea of forbidden knowledge knowledge players had back door access to but hadn t been made public by the game itself i examine the concept of forbidden knowledge within the context of traditional methods of cheating as studied by mia consalvo and demonstrate how forbidden knowledge as a social practice is an inclusive response finally i demonstrate how players make use of the mutability of web content to allow multiple visions of the same game to coexist in the form of the blaseball wiki this wiki loads random fan generated player backstories every time the page refreshes so that no single vision of the game dominates all others
