 in a strict sense i don t believe there s any definition of poetry that applies to all poets different poets have different goals different poets have different things in their hearts that they re trying to express in different ways that they want to express them are my videos where i m running around in the woods talking about yolo and dogs and dads are these really poetry why call them poetry these are the words of steve roggenbuck https www youtube com user steveroggenbuck a twenty something self proclaimed video artist and poet who released youtube videos from to roggenbuck s video poems comprised clips of his stream of consciousness often filmed while he rolled in the grass or ran through natural scenes screaming amongst random and frankly weird comments roggenbuck inserted motivational moments urging viewers to appreciate nature and follow their dreams many videos have been edited to include musical accompaniment green screen facilitated backgrounds and or additional graphics over seven years roggenbuck s fanbase grew larger and more devoted with roggenbuck being established as one of the alt lit alternative literature movement s most renowned contributors in october though roggenbuck s fans turned their backs to him as he confirmed allegations of sexual misconduct allegations that followed numerous others made against alt lit contributors there are to be sure many internet and alt lit poets roggenbuck makes for a particularly interesting case study because he embodies various facets of internet culture visual and aural disjointedness conscious contempt for grammatical correctness a poetic license so to speak premeditated performance of personality and as he has confirmed sexual harassment brought to light in the metoo moment his online persona embodies the complexities of human connection in an increasingly elo digital context rather ironically though most of his videos aim to ignite viewers passion for the natural world worms worms worms he excitedly screams as he runs through a desert in one video fucking llamas llamas whales are so big this paper introduces readers to roggenbuck s poetry and explores its place within poetic traditions by highlighting the distinctive stylistic features of his work it considers how roggenbuck s video poetry represents a kind of electronic literature that both reflects and parodies meme culture for young adult viewers less inclined to engage with poetry in printed form this paper also considers how the allegations against roggenbuck impact interpretations of his work it aims to start a conversation about negotiating literary value and socially unacceptable authorial behavior on digital platforms with new expectations and potential issues to use roggenbuck s own words i am the bard i am the poet and to be a poet while the internet exists man we got an opportunity the opportunity offered by the internet allowed roggenbuck to rise to fame it was also his demise note a version of this paper was submitted accepted to last year s elo conference but i was unable to present this work has not been presented published anywhere but i continue to work on it it s changed a lot in the last year
