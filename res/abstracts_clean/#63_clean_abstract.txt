 beyond maximalism resolving the novelistic incompatibilities of realism paranoia omniscience and encyclopedism through electronic literature in the maximalist novel ercolino defines a type of novel that displays multiform maximizing and hypertrophic tension he lists pynchon s gravity s rainbow and mason dixon wallace s infinite jest delillo s underworld smith s white teeth franzen s the corrections and bola√±o s as examples of the term and classifies the maximalist novel using ten elements length encyclopedic mode dissonant chorality diegetic exuberance completeness narratorial omniscience paranoid imagination intersemioticity ethical commitment and hybrid realism while ercolino s ten elements accurately identify and classify a significant novel form that has emerged i argue that these elements are incompatible with one another which has resulted in criticisms of maximalist novels as well as a number of maximalist novelists to abandon the form while ercolino argues that these incompatibilities represent an internal dialectic of the genre i argue that this is too conflicting to be stable as a novelistic form these incompatibilities include the incompatibility of multiple hybrid realisms the incompatibility of paranoid imagination with ethical commitment and the incompatibilities of narratorial omniscience and an encyclopedic mode with a persuasive realism by examining contemporary fictional works written by previously maximalist novelists i reassess ercolino s ten elements in order to identify the reasons why certain authors have moved beyond the limits of his definition in so doing i compare and contrast ercolino s maximalist novel with woods s hysterical realism and johnston s novel of information multiplicity using the franzen and smith corpuses as examples this paper speculates on the future form of the novel as it progresses into the st century from this literary interrogation i apply these conclusions to my digital creative practice by developing the digital novel the perfect democracy funded by the australia council for the arts this work takes as its subject the entire population of contemporary australia such a vast subject is impossible to represent in a work of fiction the whole work is presented as a d frame like artefact that can be navigated as a whole allowing readers to be presented with a multivalent broad canvas novel while resolving the paradoxical issues identified in my interrogation of ercolino i propose that this will be achieved by utilising calvino s six memos images of australian currency will be used as a structural device to remove weight by representing the whole society from the richest to the poorest in the quickest way possible and a multitude of simultaneous digital writing formats and voices will be used to precisely depict characterisation elo works cited calvino i six memos for the next millennium trans p creagh london vintage johnston j information multiplicity american fiction in the age of media saturation baltimore the johns hopkins university press smith z this is how it feels to me the guardian retrieved from https www theguardian com books oct fiction afghanistan accessed november wood j human all too inhuman the new republic online retrieved from https newrepublic com article human inhuman accessed november
