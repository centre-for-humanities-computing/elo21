{"start": "00:50:27.240", "end": "00:50:38.520", "speaker": "Caitlin Fisher", "utterance": " So maybe, what we need to do is find somebody who would spearhead all of these because I can imagine that dina has the energy sector at all of them into moderate so easily at all of them, but I mean, I think."}

{"start": "00:52:10.350", "end": "00:52:14.400", "speaker": "Deena Larsen", "utterance": " And even if we just did it for six months, so it will be a six month commitment."}
