 writing to cope anti shipping rhetoric in media fandom allegra rosenberg over the last decade as the varied and diverse participatory cultures of media fandom have moved from home to home and been populated anew by younger generations with priorities aﬀected by general cultural shi s norms are changing almost too quickly to be documented formerly sacred concepts such as the fourth wall the dividing line between creators known as the powers that be or tptb and fans have been broken down accepted practices of creation and participation are being challenged brit kelley has detailed the movement over the last few years towards the platform model of fandom in which the nearly global connectedness of twitter has further lowered the bar for interaction between creative producers and fans this has had an increasingly visible eﬀect on the digital spaces in which transformative fanworks speciﬁcally erotic literature and artwork are shared i am not interested in untangling the actual ethical implications behind individual examples of problematic erotic material or pathologizing either its supporters or its decriers instead i am seeking to examine the eﬀects the recent shi s in digital platforming of fandom culture has had on the discourse around its production and consumption through the lens boyd and marwick deﬁne as context collapse and jurgenson and davis separate out into context collision and context collusion as well as through joanna russ s writing on the authoring of and aﬀective responses to erotic fan literature abigail de kosnik cites several examples of fandom participation as activism noting that since many fans have committed to making social justice and critical accountability part of their fandom practice recent events in the world of digitally platformed fandom have illuminated not only the increasingly visible struggle among fans to deﬁne what constitutes acceptable works to produce and consume but the ways in which the collapse of formerly standard fandom contexts have aﬀected that struggle on october screenwriter and showrunner bryan fuller retweeted to his twitter account a pornographic artwork depicting the two main characters of his show nbc s hannibal engaging in explicitly depicted oral sex fuller an out gay man known for his irreverent social media presence and support for the central ship or quasi canonical relationship between hannibal lecter and will graham quickly became the subject of controversy amongst the hannibal fan community you aint never gon catch me replying to nsfw fanart of my employees that shit weird as hell lmao tweeted one user bro wtf it s disgusting tweeted another fuller responded i m not disgusted by art i m disgusted by cruelty i m disgusted by hate i m disgusted by those who would shame others for expressing themselves creatively the artist in question was identiﬁed by twitter users as belonging to a group known as the rainbow meats its really unprofessional as a creator of a show to be interacting with such nsfw art especially by someone who is in a known group that supports pedophilia stated one twitter user categorically denouncing fuller s tweet according to fanlore the fandom culture wiki maintained by the organization for transformative works otw anti shipper or just an anti has been used in the s to describe fans who disapprove of a ship and its shippers due to the ship being considered problematic or morally wrong fanlore n d within the hannibal twitter community aﬃliation with one side or another became indicated by the use of demonstrative emojis in display names or proﬁle descriptions position and in response or rainbow meat to indicate a pro shipper or steak knife indicated the opposite this ongoing controversy known as the hannibal twitter wars fanlore n d shed a public light on a general trend that has been gaining momentum in digital fan spaces in conjunction with with the continued active engagement of fuller with supportive followers and against critical ones the argument spiraled from one about the appropriateness of the speciﬁc explicit art in question and into one with much higher and broader stakes embedded in this incident of fantagonism deﬁned by derek johnson as ongoing competitive struggles between both internal factions and external institutions to discursively codify the fan text producer relationship according to their respective interests and exposed to a wide audience by its very public nature were clear delineations between the essential perspectives of the anti shipper or more plainly anti frequently fancop and conversely the pro shipper or anti anti just like any other social group the identiﬁcation of an enemy within fandom is a powerful factor in social cohesion zubernis larsen these relatively niche positions and the fervor with which they are defended from entrenched distances across digital spaces are reﬂective of the deep emotional attachment which fans have to their beliefs about how fandom practices should and shouldn t be performed certainly the deeply political language used around pro anti shipping arguments reﬂects the issue s prioritization in the minds of its proponents this is particularly important in the public landscape of twitter where their fandom activities are visible to the world at large and there is an intrinsic desire to be seen as good fans in the eyes of that potentially inﬁnite collapsed public the sanctioning of deviant in group members is particularly harsh when there is an external audience with some powers of sanction which it can be argued is always the case on the internet as opposed to a deserted high school hallway zubernis larsen henry jenkins predicted in convergence culture that one of the skills young people would need in order to become full ﬂedged participants in the oncoming cultural shi he characterized as convergence culture was the ability to share and compare value systems by evaluating ethical dramas what has emerged in the platform stage of fandom culture is a mildly dystopian version of this outcome in which the constant and heated evaluation of ethical dramas and one s position within those evaluations plays a central role in the identities of individual fans and intra fandom communities fandom has always been a space in which diﬀering opinions become co present competing interests struggling to deﬁne interpretative and evaluative consensus johnson but the highly public politicization of those diﬀering opinions is a phenomenon which speaks to novel trends in fandom as well as social media s potential to amplify and complicate those trends hannibal which was popular on tumblr during its original airing period of was released onto netﬂix in resulting in a new wave of fans gathering on twitter many in their teens who had been too young to watch hannibal during its original airing this new wave coincided with the late s rise of the platform model and the transformation of fandom culture from individualized siloed communities with speciﬁc rules and mores to mere commercial segments of larger mainstream app communities with ﬂuid shi ing boundaries a conversation with a young fan following the controversy summed up fuller s hardline stance against the anti shippers bryanfuller a little reminder for whoever needs it gif of hannibal saying it s ok to be weird user hey bryan ive watched hannibal ever since the ﬁrst episode aired and the ﬁrst season of american gods b you le im confused as to why you re taking the side of pedophile incest zoophile supporters defenders really only supporting them its a really bad look on ya dude bryanfuller they re not any of those things you ve twisted their art artistic expression into those extremes because you don t understand art history greco roman mythology or metaphorical allegorical or thematic storytelling your narrowmindedness is your own shortcoming not theirs celia lam noted the result of the shi decades ago between analog and digital production of fanﬁction and transformative fanworks in the public visibility of online publication the insular nature of fan ﬁction which could practically be maintained in its previous oﬄine mode is dispelled this loss of insularity has only accelerated thanks to the adoption of newer more public platforms for fan activity the comparatively locked and private worlds of mailing lists and livejournal communities gave rise to tumblr from there fandom practices moved to dominant social media platforms such as twitter where they have become visible alongside non fandom political and otherwise mainstream conversation kohnen more speciﬁcally a er tumblr banned nsfw not safe for work content in late the shared practices of representation and interpretation of erotic content on tumblr tiidenberg were destroyed in moving to twitter and leaving those shared practices behind as well as the protective aﬀordances that tumblr s interface lent to their interactions nsfw and erotic content became much more visible to and accessible by a broader platformed public danah boyd s work on context collapse preﬁgures the current era of fandom culture but is useful in identifying the nature of the changes in digital communication that have led to the present situation moreso by far than livejournal and tumblr fandom content on twitter has the chance to reach outside its intended audience all the while inside an environment in which the networked audience has a presumption of personal authenticity and connection boyd marwick kelley notes that the nearly global connectedness of twitter has further lowered the bar for interaction between creative producers and fans and the subsequent damage to the so called fourth wall has irrevocably changed the way fans communicate and behave with regards to public ﬁgures such as actors writers and brands in contrast to the relatively sanitized and bland corporate feeds examined by kelley however fuller s unusually interactive and authentic involvement with the transformative side of fandom over a period of years spanning the show s airing and post cancellation revival williams provides an alternative lens into the dark side of context collapse and the platforming of fan culture while historically fans have seen themselves as resistant to dominant forms of consumption kelley twitter s acceleration of the breakdown of the boundaries between creators and fans and younger generations of fans increasing acceptance of the public and corporate nature of fandom as given has changed the stakes jenkins according to zubernis larsen there is o en a sense of self righteousness on the part of those attempting to police other fans behavior a sense that this is a necessary step to protect the community and maintain standards in a community that is not only publicly accessible to the millions of non fan users of twitter but by the creators and performers of popular works themselves this two way policing seems almost inevitable the seeming endorsement in this case of series creator bryan fuller led to the entrenchment of pro shipper and anti shipper positions in reaction what bertha chin identiﬁes as the social capital inherent in approval from the tptb is the currency with which fans ideas and works are imbued in practice the performance of the fan via tweeting and perhaps even behaving appropriately will attract the attention of the celebrity or the media producer thus gaining the fans status and recognition in both the eyes of the producers celebrities and other fans during the fuller kerfuﬄe the declared alliance with an enemy group the pro shippers caused a ri in the fandom with some fans declaring that they would no longer support fuller as a creator that his support of the pro shipper contingent was unacceptable the problem at hand is in no small part due to the deeply aﬀective nature of individual reactions to sexual or taboo content conversations about the moral appropriateness of taboo kinky content have been endemic to fan spaces speciﬁcally spaces where literature is produced speciﬁcally for erotic purposes for as long as such spaces have existed joanna russ s essay pornography by women for women with love examines the presence of such content in kirk spock erotica and comes to an important conclusion i m convinced a er reading through more than ﬁ y volumes of k s material most of it x rated that only those for whom a sexual fantasy works that is those who are aroused by it have a chance of telling us to what particular set of conditions that fantasy speaks and can analyze how and why it works and for whom sexual fantasy that doesn t arouse is boring funny or repellent and unsympathetic outsiders trying to decode these fantasies or any others will make all sorts of mistakes referring speciﬁcally in this case to rape fantasies and other abusive fantasies such as those depicting violence and injury leading to sex russ s acknowledgement that those outsiders who are repelled by fantasies and erotic content that does not arouse them have no chance of understanding or sympathizing with the mechanisms behind its production contextualizes the moral conﬂict that has arisen on social media around issues relating to transformative works in kelley s recognition of fanﬁction as an emotioned aﬀective practice she quotes kylie jarrett s argument that the aﬀective intensities experienced by the user also reproduce a subjective positioning that reﬂects an ideological social relation in which even the most intimate of experiences are open to albeit never entirely captured by the structures of exploitation associated with capital social media platforms as marketed products exist within these structures so too do their users the purposeful gathering of fellow minded fans in a digital space whose aﬀordances are dictated by commercial needs frequently produces the negative consequences of what jurgensen and david identify as context collusions which occur when users draw on the aﬀordances of interaction platforms to bring together multiple networks for varying purposes and to varying degrees in order to share their work on twitter an artist or writer must contend with the possibility of it being viewed by those who have no interest in it those who might be oﬀended by it or in the case of fuller those who amplify it to hundreds of thousands of followers and spark oﬀ a days long controversy on a platform such as twitter where the networked digital structures of expression and connection are overwhelmingly characterized by aﬀect papacharissi the platform aﬀordances that restrict twitter conversation to character threads and encourage the construction of each individual user s identity as an ongoing response to an imagined or real audience boyd mean that perceived approval or defense of let alone arousal by transgressive content by any given user has the potential to evoke fear and disgust in any other user or group of users a process that reduces the spectrum of possible reactions even further from the limited options provided by the platform vice versa the need to defend the creation or consumption of such content can easily become an essential part of one s public identity as a fan zubernis and larsen s book fandom at the crossroads examines issues of fan shame bullying and the complicated nature of physical desire in fandom practices using psychological and therapeutic approaches they discuss fanﬁction through the lens of coping strategies to deal with past trauma explaining how catharsis and written emotional expression displaced through ﬁction fanﬁc or otherwise may oﬀer a greater sense of safety and control and facilitate development of a more resilient sense of self anti shipper philosophy on the other hand posits that fan literature and art dealing with morally reprehensible themes of pedophilia incest and abuse as might appear in such cathartic literature are outright harmful and should not under any circumstances be written shared or consumed within the high strung discursive ﬁeld of fandom politics the dialectically opposed hardline rhetoric of these self declared positions does not allow for much nuance additionally the extremely public nature of the debates lends itself to misunderstanding simpliﬁcation and stereotyping what is seen by pro shippers as simply the desire for everyone to be able to write draw and publish what they want even if it oﬀends or squicks is viewed by anti shippers as unforgivably harmful questions about the moral responsibility of art and literature have been debated for thousands of years from plato onwards as recently as a decade ago when zubernis larsen were investigating the wincest shipping community in the supernatural fandom shipping two ﬁctional brothers was seen largely as an activity perfectly in line with the transformative subversive erotics of adult participation in fanﬁction cultures the common writing to cope argument in line with zubernis larsen s assessment that the writing of fanﬁction can be seen as a relatively pure form of re authoring one s own narrative a freedom emphasized in the research as crucial to therapeutic outcomes may be useful to some but the idea that one must be forced to disclose one s past trauma in order to be allowed to write ﬁction that deals with it could easily backﬁre as kelley draws our attention to fanﬁction is a deeply emotioned practice with aﬀect circulating within a given community and sticking to bodies some more so than others in this case the platform era of fandom has had the eﬀect of introducing niche fetishism into a public sphere populated partly with those to whom such intense obsession with taboo sexuality is a total cipher unable to be comprehended because it does not arouse aﬀect transmutes as it crosses these broken down boundaries from arousal to deep instinctive disgust becoming in the process an intensely sticky and distressing phenomenon to which the instinct is to disavow and protect against the rhetorically reductive assignation of cultural signiﬁers like pedophilic abusive and freak to those who interact with and or create certain ﬁctional or visual types of taboo pornography is per wetherell s deﬁnition an example of aﬀective discursive meaning making in the context of the ongoing social event of fandom distilling down into visceral simplicity users own reactions to its entry into their conscious awareness subsequently such signiﬁers lend power to the arsenal of an anti shipper s semantic arguments framing their moral perspective to outsiders in visceral simplicity that it s diﬃcult to argue with the same path is traced on the opposite side as demonstrated by fuller s alignment with the pro shipping position the corresponding signiﬁers assigned to the opposition being narrowminded in fuller s words as well as commonly puritans and dumb teens also allow for a discursive path to dismissing broader concerns about ﬁction s eﬀect on reality and the reproduction of real world harms through transformative fanworks flourish klink host of fan culture podcast fansplaining described the conﬂict when you yourself feel like you re under siege it can be really hard to hear any other perspectives than your own fansplaining for every writer or creator who engages with or creates problematic content in order to cope with past traumas and will defend the general right to do the same regardless of disclosure of a traumatic past there s one for whom the mere existence of such content and its easy accessibility via an online platform like ao is deeply painful to confront and for whom the publicly displayed support of pro shipper mentality by a formerly trusted creator like fuller is a betrayal of the highest order an example of this can be seen in the semi annual responses to the archive of our own s ao donation drives the ao a central repository of transformative fan literature was founded in in response to threats of censorship for explicit content from livejournal among other issues de kosnik the archive s terms of service explicitly permit rape violence and underage content which must be warned for using the interface s default archive warning system incest abuse and other potentially problematic topics can be further voluntarily warned for in the additional tags section in response to ao s calls for donations a regular event in the lifecycle of any non proﬁt organization posts are made on tumblr and twitter decrying ao and those who donate to them on the basis of the archive s open allowance of these types of content on a tumblr post commenting on the necessity of donation to ao a user replied ao is a pedophiles safe haven and everything on it should burn also save your own content another user replying to the same post identifying themselves as a survivor of child sexual abuse declared that if you have the right to claim that ﬁctional pedophilia is harmless and good and spread it i have every right as a csa survivor to be disgusted by y all activist pro shippers have taken it upon themselves to document the origin and makeup of the fancop philosophy drawing equivalences with terf trans exclusive radical feminist thought and speciﬁcally american strains of protestant puritanism dionysiaca the desire of activist anti shippers on the other hand to harshly condemn the immoral activities of both self identiﬁed pro shippers and unaﬃliated parties with reactions ranging from displays of disaﬃliation to active harassment and punitive public cancellation can be seen as not only as a desire to exert power over members of their community but as a genuine counterpart to their progressive feminist ideals the sometimes violent methods of disaﬃliation that anti shippers resort to in their strategies of content policing include doxxing harassment brigading and mass reporting a user on the anonymous fandom forum fail_fandomanon posted a plaintive commentary on the phenomenon speciﬁcally in relation to fuller and the disturbing responses to his support of pro shipping ideals i would really like to be able to peacefully browse hannibal content on tumblr twitter without running into deranged antis calling for violence against bryan fuller it would be diﬀerent if it was just the same old toothless proship dni crap but this gleeful shameless pride in calling for his death is sickening they re absolutely convinced they are in the moral right and there s no grey area of any kind i don t know what to do it s probably not going to get better the presumption of personal authenticity and connection inherent in social media identiﬁed by boyd gives rise to the need within platformed fandom for one s public persona to represent the truth of oneself encompassing an authentic representation of beliefs and priorities a young user demonstrating their aﬃliation with the anti shipping community by placing or proshippers dni do not interact in their bio is an easy way to signal that they do not approve of what they as anti shippers perceive to be the pro shipper modus operandi inﬂicting real world damage by producing or consuming works illustrated or written depicting harmful power dynamics between ﬁctional characters the merging of youth activist spaces with fandom spaces has been documented as far back as the social justice culture of tumblr kohnen as ursula k le guin said immature people crave and demand moral certainty this is bad this is good kids and adolescents struggle to ﬁnd a sure moral foothold in this bewildering world they long to feel they re on the winning side or at least a member of the team with media fandom as a far less subversive and private cultural practice than it was even ten years ago its more taboo elements are in the process of being surfaced and criticized through fourth wall breaking events like the hannibal twitter wars as if a rock were being li ed up and the complex isolated ecology below was exposed to light for the ﬁrst time with wide ranging consequences the eﬀect of formerly private fandom practices such as the production of erotic literature and art being widely observed and subsequently subsumed into the broadly platformed cultural matrix of social media is complex and ongoing increased visibility from and incorporation into the larger machinery of cultural production jenkins has resulted in fandom s attempt to jettison the more unsavory elements of fan identity embrace of taboo sexuality o en queer and or female and the shamelessness around that embrace zubernis larsen wondered nearly a decade ago if the open acknowledgement in various public forums that fanﬁction isn t universally derided will eventually result in decreased fan shame and increased fan openness now the outcome of that acknowledgement can be seen clearly in the ongoing discursive battles over taboo subjects in fanﬁction and fanart being waged on social media the production of transformative works itself is no longer nearly as controversial now it is the type kind and subject of such works that is becoming open to scrutiny fan openness has increased yes but the cost of such visibility can be seen in the increased harassment over participation in formerly private practices the intrusion of creators into fan spaces and the heightened discursive stakes surrounding what the production and consumption of transformative works says about any given individual s morality and beliefs sources cited anti shipper
