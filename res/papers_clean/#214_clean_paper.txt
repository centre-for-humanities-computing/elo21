computer generated books metonymic metaphoric and operationalist dr zach whalen university of mary washington every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences whereas by his contrivance the most ignorant person at a reasonable charge and with a little bodily labour might write books in philosophy poetry politics laws mathematics and theology without the least assistance from genius or study gulliver s travels into several remote nations of the world swift in gulliver s travels the professor quoted above has devised a mechanical means for creating speculative knowledge and proposes that merely or so of these stochastic frames would be necessary to complete the work of the arts and sciences with only a few folios of broken sentences to show for the work the professor is nevertheless granted an assurance from lemuel gulliver that he this unnamed professor will retain sole intellectual property rights to this invention now merely a few centuries after jonathan swift composed this parody of intellectualism artists and writers with knowledge engines far more capable than even five hundred of the lagodan professor s engines are creating folios filled with sentences of many kinds this book generating machine and especially its illustration as in judy mollow s recent merged with a screen for days is a frequent motif for writers interested in generative literature and computing history more generally but in this paper i am interested more in the books produced by such engines in the th century artists writers and programmers found many different reasons to employ a computer in service of creating a book and thanks to the energy around nanogenmo national novel generation month now hundreds of these books have been programmed into existence in the st century with such diversity of motivations methods and means behind computer generated books the breadth of the field makes it difficult to situate these works within the array of genres and forms typically considered to constitute electronic literature to say nothing of the fact that the material status print of many of these books may in fact lie beyond some definitions of electronic literature where a computer is said to be essential in both creation and consumption even for screen essentialist conceptions of electronic literature however the formal patterns of the codex book persist beyond the bound in efficiencies of the paper platform for some of these digital works like judd nelson s the jew s daughter or jason nelson s evidence of everything exploding the printed page becomes a platform for the mutability of the screen while in other works like amaranth borsuk and brad bouse s between page and screen or steve tomosula s toc the intermedial space explores a tension between the printed and the projected word still other works are conceived digitally but arrive in print form like nick montfort s recent golem montfort and the books ten so far in counterpath s using electricity series using electricity series n d scholarly work on computer generated fiction has tended to focus on narrative noah wardrip fruin s expressive processing or text the general field of natural language processing and or more recently leah henrickson among others has been illuminating the ways human readers respond to and interpret computer generated text via shifting ideas about authorship henrickson in recent elo conference presentations i have called for more focus on the content of the generated books and i am pursuing that line of inquiry in a larger study of which this present paper is a part in this paper i propose a framework for classifying the differences among computer generated books relative to their characteristics apparent purposes by articulating three broad genres or perhaps heuristics metonymic metaphoric and operationalist i am attempting to provide more entry points into this otherwise large field that can be resistant to easy summarization additionally identifying the syntactic and semantic architectures of these genres allows me to locate fields of practice and art typically situated outside of literary studies that nevertheless provide salient precedents and audiences for computer generated literature taxonomy is always a fraught premise a tentative hedge against mutability that inevitably fails to include a comprehensive account of any phenomenon so describing and fleshing out a taxonomy cannot be an end unto itself rather i hope it can serve as a shortcut to consonant and disparate features among sets in a way that will obviate repetitive descriptions in this way my hope is that a discussion of these types will provide a useful introduction and heuristic to the field definitions for the sake of this paper and the i am focusing on computer generated books that found their way into print including print on demand and artist s books but i will also be including several works that exist only or at least primarily as pdf documents pdfs are of course digital files but i agree with lisa gitelman s characterization of pdfs as near print gitelman in that they replicate many of the formal economic and bureaucratic qualities of printed documents as well as demonstrating what matthew kirschenbaum calls formal materiality in mechanisms specifically pdfs gesture toward individuality and immutability at least rhetorically and they circulate for consumption as the endpoints of processes both bookish and bureaucratic as gitelman writes pdfs are individually bounded and distinct already authored entities understood as distinct from the written systems in and by which they are individually named and potentially manipulated or downloaded they are therefore close enough to printed books that they merit inclusion in this analysis additionally pdfs are by convention the work product of a successful nanogenmo entry and the hundreds of books completed for this annual event provide a great many of the examples to follow briefly i consider books to be computer generated when some form of programming or computation has been necessary in the composition of a book s contents that composition may include aleatory or deterministic algorithms artificial intelligence or simple regular expressions a human s involvement in the compositional process can vary from very little to books that are best considered dialogic collaborations between a computer and a human author but since as far as i know no computer has independently decided to write a book on its own initiative these differences are best viewed as a continuum focusing on the nuances and limitations of that continuum is beyond the scope of this paper and better suited for studies that examine the meaning of authorship in these contexts literary genres programming methods and programming languages provide additional classifications of computer generated books judith van stegeren s taxonomy of methods used in nanogenmo is an excellent framework van stegeren and theune and my ongoing project nanogenmocat is an attempt to curate and catalog a comprehensive archive of all nanogenmo books whalen but i believe the typology i am proposing here will build on these existing systems to help identify recurring themes influential communities of practice and a broader range of literary and artistic antecedents finally the norms and features that this typology delineates can also provide a basis for appreciative criticism of these works because these are in a way value judgments with respect to the pleasures of these generated texts in focusing on the generated books themselves i consider books to be metonymic when their most salient meaning invokes what jessica pressman calls aesthetic bookishness or the medium of books in general these are books readers recognize via resemblance to books in general in material or graphical terms by contrast books that are metaphoric ask readers to recognize contingency in the generated book as pastiche satire deformation or some other rhetorical mode relating it to some specific other book or genre of book while creators of metonymic and metaphoric books tend more often than not to make their processes transparent usually by making their source code available those who produce operationalist may obscure their methods or if processes are discernible these mechanizations are the focal point of the book s interest to put it another way operationalist books are those for which a principal interest is the premise that a computer has generated this book in terms of reception perception and interpretation works that emphasize their metonymic relationship to books tend to be interesting to look at books that exploit a metaphoric relationship to specific books tend to be interesting to read and books that rely on operationalist premises tend to be interesting to know about metonymic mediation works that are metonymic are sculptural or artifactual in making an appeal to bookishness after jessica pressman s term through the characteristics of their material existence these works include luigi amato and roberto arista s volume amato which includes as its contents its literal self description in terms of weight width height indexicality and jean keller s the black book which maximizes the value of a self printed book by printing each page in solid black keller the role of computation in the creation of these works is at least implied and their status as metonymy for the concrete presence of books draws in other works with different origins prior to nanogenmo many of the best examples of metonymic generated books could be considered artist s books arguably the example of a book composed by a computer process is an instructive example the book a million random digits with normal deviates was first published in by the rand corporation with a second edition in and an online edition is currently available on the rand corporation s website rand corporation rand corporation this book originated as a research tool supporting statistical and cryptographic inquiries where a supply of high quality random numbers is helpful for validation purposes and artists such as john cage and jackson mac low used this book and others like it to direct their chance driven composition techniques sample to consider the book itself as a literary object may strain the limits of literary genre but the reception and reviews of the book that jokingly treat it as though it is literature validate the book s status as metonymy all books and although there are instances of books of random numbers and logarithmic tables the continued circulation of a million random digits as a literary text merits its status perhaps the earliest example of computer generated literature taking the form of a book for example on goodreads where the book currently enjoys a out stars reviewers praise a million random digits unpredictability its development of noteworthy characters like and its well deserved status as a literary classic a million random digits with normal deviates n d what these and similar reviews on amazon depend on is the ironic distance between the book s supposed purpose and material fact of its existence the massy volumetric presence of the first edition is recognizable as member of the set of all books and every aspect of its design typography layout metadata paratextual material as well as its circulation as a bibliographic object confirm its status as a member of that set but the fact that it resists anything like conventional reading turns attention only to those features it shares with other books other generated books with metonymic demonstrations of their bookishness are similarly difficult or at least different to read and this includes artists books like the aforementioned black book and volume writing about print on demand projects like black book hannes bajohr coins a term auto factography to recognize works that make specific emphasis on the relationship between digital file and printed book while feeding back their output into their aesthetic practices bajohr as one approach to bookish metonymy auto factographic experimental literature that embraces or exploits the accessibility of print on demand services like lulu and blurb is often computer generated in some way but even those with more analog origin stories are deeply involved in digital textuality auto factographic books are situated at the intersection between print and digital text and they interrogate that intersection through their content textuality or form as it concresces in a physical form for the many computer generated books that exist only as digital files that metatextual interrogation is still key even when that relationship to print is implied instead of literal within the corpus of books created for nanogenmo many projects participate in this metonymic mediation by relying on something other than readability for their message works like asemic writing by john ohno and the cover of the sun also rises by duncan regan are examples that conceptualize an individual moment of inscription and highlight the ephemerality of that inscription and liza daly s seraphs a procedurally generated mysterious codex uses a voynich like font to mimic generically the glyphs and motifs of the mysterious voynich manuscript seraphs and the voynich manuscript are approximately equal in their il legibility but both perform an idea about the shape and purpose of esoteric books as potentially magical objects allison parrish s ahe thd yearidy ti isa is another example of an illegible book that is additionally a metonymy for computer generated books to produce this work parrish used an artificial intelligence approach normally best suited for image classification and generation and trained it to recognize and generate images of letters and numbers the generated letters which parrish s code arranges first into word like sequences and then into sentences paragraphs and pages look uncannily familiar yet are never quite correct the reason these fail to resolve has to do with the learning model inherent to the ai in use a generative adversarial network that trains its understanding of a data set by extracting salient features of samples locating those features in an n dimensional space containing all samples and inferring that new members of that set must exist in the latent space between those features the problem for text is that whereas for bitmaps of images modifying the color of a single pixel might make a noisy image incrementally more similar to some target image typographic glyphs are indexical and relatively sparse in terms of the information required to recognize a small bitmap as an image of one letter or another the fact that one can almost read ahe thd yearidy ti isa is its most remarkable feature the nanogenmo adjacent corpus also includes several other works that present themselves as metonymic statements about or for books and computer generated literature this includes chiefly graphical works like greg kennedy s graphic novel generated detective everest pipkins s project a thoroughfare beat across the wilderness that google street view imagery to record a speculative path for data transmissions lines sandra shtabnaya s ascii ocean that converts frames of video into ascii art and compiles the result as pages in a pdf or mark rickerby s emic automata that treats words as units for a cellular automata my an arthrogram and vaudn oc horrrr are also metonymic examples of computer generated comics in discussing and characterizing metonymy as a specific genre for computer generated books i have intentionally avoided referring to these as concrete because of that word s specialized activation of concrete poetry a term which has a diverse and sometimes contested status that lies beyond the scope of this paper but many of the books under consideration here can be said to validate the axiomatic linking of structure to content especially if one includes here the ways in which the apparatuses of book design production and printing are all kinds of formal structure that can become visible as content in summary metonymic works are formally media specific often unreadable and poetically concretist in their meaning and while creators have positioned the referential status of these books to serve different rhetorical agendas the artifactual salience of these computer generated works trope that sets these books apart from other projects metaphoric any computer generated book may follow one or more existing literature genres fiction non fiction poetry or theater and within communities of practice like nanogenmo methodologies and recurring themes can be analogous to genre categories in providing interpretive shortcuts between creators and their audience unlike metonymic books where their signaled status as a book accomplishes its meaning metaphoric are those books where the meaning is contingent upon a specific other book or literary genre rather than representing all books these metaphoric books operate generically to satirize remix parody critique or in some other way stand in place of their referents for some purpose the methods programmers use may be stochastic deterministic or statistical but they each begin with a specific work or works and rely for their meaning on readers recognizing the reference this includes the many methods following the tradition if not usually the exact process of hugh kenner and joseph o rourke s travesty generator this is the method for creating a new text based on one or more original texts where the distribution of n length sequences in the generated text matches that in the original kenner and o rourke significantly even though few if any generated books used their exact method kenner and o rourke posit their innovation not for its programmatic novelty but for its utility in producing literary travesty which byte magazine editor g michael vose defines as a distorted stylistically incongruous translation or imitation of a literary or artistic endeavor vose this disposition toward imitation or incongruous translation is the hallmark feature of works that i classify as metaphoric and this is also evident in the similar though much older method of generating sequences using andrej markov s algorithm so called markov chains have been used for text generation as far back as their original articulation in his lecture outlining the method for computing sequences within serial data markov demonstrated the unreasonable effectiveness of his method to generate a sequence of letters in imitation of pushkin s eugene onegin markov when claude shannon uses the technique in his paper a mathematical theory of communication he is not focused on literary critique evaluating his results as at least passable language sequences of four or more words can easily be placed in sentences without unusual or strained constructions the particular sequence of ten words attack on an english writer that the character of this is not at all unreasonable shannon shannon does not disclose the book from which these sequences are derived but the phrase attack on an english writer ironically anticipates kenner and o rourke s observation that their pseudo text is disconcertingly recognizable when trained on specific writers kenner and o rourke kenner and o rourke s method and the related explorations of parodic markov chains produce results with at least momentary interest but their status as linguistic novelties generally precluded their being published as books however computer generated poetry offers some examples of the metaphoric disposition for example energy crisis poems a short book published in by rjs strikes a parodic tone in stanzas like compoundings of senile enlightenment flagellate emptily from elemental origins to computed complexity and the author programmer wryly notes that with this program massive quantities of mediocre poetry can now be created with minimal effort from the poet r j s et al i consider this self awareness metaphoric because the poems presented by rjs as mediocre presumably stand in place of better poetry by better poets and in this way energy crisis poems is reminiscent of the earlier auto beatnik circa christopher strachey s love letters or even joseph weizenbaum s eliza where for each one level of the joke is essentially that a particular form of expression avant garde poetry epistolary affection and psychotherapy are evidently so far removed from actual human insight that even a computer can produce plausible examples more broadly if generated books of a metaphoric disposition are contingent upon some earlier work or style and programmatically transformed into a new text so quite a few different methods of transformation beyond the travesty genre are resonant in purpose and modes of reception jason huff s autosummarize uses microsoft word s autosummarize sentence function to make much shorter versions of classic literary works and huff s collaboration with mimi cabell to collect the constellations of ads that appearing in gmail after sending the full text of american psycho between two accounts these works are contingent on earlier literary works but by transforming these works by mis using corporate software huff and cabell also position their work as critique those software regimes and the technological infrastructure in which knowledge circulates within nanogenmo quite a few noteworthy projects operate within a metaphoric mode including many that involve markov chains or similar travesty generator techniques imitating the greats by aaronfink and mythology the slap a post geometric futurist manifesto by accraze are typical in that they combine multiple sources into a markov model before generating text and shamanoor s romeo and juliet in whatsapp dialogue cleverly uses markov chains to generate text that is then passed through other filtering and formatting so that readers may view it through a specific interpretive and stylistic filter and similarly taphos by nathan mifsud begins uses markov chains to generate text hybridized from a book of the dead and literary criticism about the death of the novel before degrading that resulting text in several entropic stages computer generated books that transform respond to critique satirize or in some other metaphorically relevant way are among the popular and well known examples of nanogenmo books this is owes much to the fact that it is possible to convey the idea of many of these works and their interventions in a brief sentence pride and prejudice but with dialogue scraped from twitter twide and twejudice by michelle fullwood moby dick but all the words are spoonerisms doby mick or the excessively spoonerized whale by chris pressey through the looking glass but with the dialogue from pride and prejudice through the prejudice glass by leonard richardson moby dick but every instance of words that could be a sophomoric euphemisms is followed by a parenthetical giggle moby dick hehe by matthew vickers some of these transformations can involve simple yet clever character substitutions that suggest an alternative point of view for representing a classic work as in christina montemorano s paradissssse lossssst that re tells the epic poem in the voice of the serpent by drawing out every s sound or hugovk s meows that transforms any text including moby dick into meows others involve more elaborate transformations and transpositions that nevertheless depend on replacing some earlier text with a new yet still readable document that refracts the originals in some meaningful way the nanogenmo book ready player n by katstasaph transforms any book to make it more like ernest cline s ready player one by inserting unnecessary pop culture references the following moment from the climactic confrontation near the end of mary shelley s frankenstein is thereby made more relevant to a modern audience well steeped in geek cultural lore i have declared my resolution to you and i am no coward to bend beneath words leave me i am inexorable it is well i go but remember i shall be with you on your wedding night rather like night city from the cyberpunk ip i started forward and exclaimed villain before you sign my death very much like the death star warrant be sure that you are yourself safe i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation in a few moments i saw him in his boat pretty much like sonny crocket s scarab in miami vice but not as badass which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves katstasaph this project is more pointed in its critique and is more clearly a work of parody than some of the other more conceptual or incidental works in this genre of books with a metaphoric orientation the sample above includes several different takes on moby dick and it is true that herman melville and jane austen are clearly over represented within the nanogenmo corpus as i have argued elsewhere the visibility of these two authors within this community of practice that among other things creates new works that are based on earlier works derives from the status of moby dick and pride and prejudice within the literary canon so much so that these are among the books that may first come to mind when an artist with an idea for remixing a book needs to find some book to plug into that algorithm in this way these contingent books still warrant consideration as demonstrations of metaphoric computer generated books but in many cases their interest lies in the work accomplished by the algorithm and not as much in whatever critique is implied by making melville and austen the source texts for these algorithms in other words these two classic novels stand in as metonymic placeholders for literary fiction in general and less as subjects of critique in their own rights in all these examples and many more computer generated books can be considered metaphoric when they are clearly contingent on prior works they are generally readable transparent or even trivial in their processes and frequently hilarious operationalist finally works that i consider operationalist follow neil harris s description of p t barnum s method of showmanship as demonstrating an operational aesthetic for these computer generated books the audience may be left with some doubt as to the origins and mechanization of the book so this may include books where readers have some reason to doubt whether it was really generated by a computer program and books that have attempted to pass as human authored in other cases the books specific or general readable or concrete are composed through processes that are more interesting than the resulting novel in all of these cases what unites them is that the operations of authorship are among the principle signifying characteristics of these works although many of the examples to follow are also noteworthy for metonymic and metaphoric reasons as well harris s book one explains the success of p t barnum s showmanship much of which was based on artful deception as owing in part to american audiences increasing scientific literacy and mechanical processes which harris extends to include the rhetorical processes of belief skepticism and revelation that accompany hoaxes and their unveiling harris shane denson and andreas jahn sudmann leverage tom gunning s observation of this aesthetic in film to call for similar understandings of the serial and procedural logic of video games denson and jahn sudmann and johannah king slutzky is recognizing something by comparing overly determined and needlessly complex twitter bots to rube goldberg machines in my analysis i label those books operationalist instead of operationally aesthetic to refer to two general subtypes of projects those which are opaque secretive or even deceptive about their processes and those for which a specific process is evident but it that process is more compelling through its conceptual originality specificity or goldbergian complexity than either the artifact it produces this operationalist set includes such classics of the computer generated field as the policeman s beard is half constructed by racter just this once by scott french bagabone hem i die now by melpomene true love by alexander prokopovich and the day a computer writes a novel by ghostwriter and satoshi sato sato each of these books have several things in common each received press coverage each is at least vague about its source code and each to some extent anthropomorphizes the programming code that produced it in each of these cases and several more a key element in the velocity of the project has to do with the premise that a computer wrote a book this premise of computer authorship may be unearned in some cases but the power of that attribution speaks to the same impulses that drive the eliza effect the popularized conception of the turing test and even the general ai of science fiction writing a novel is hard and because more people presumably admire novel writers than have written novels the craft or process of writing of novel writing carries a significant amount of mystique for a computer to write a novel the operational aesthetic seems to say either novel writing is more mechanical than i realized or computers are more advanced than i realized neither of these suppositions are necessarily ever true but their logic is similar to the logic that attracted p t barnum s audiences in other words sometimes a supposed computer generated book is a hoax i can make no definitive claims about any of the examples listed here although i have suspicions but the potential harmfulness of computer generated text is exemplified clearly in the case of scigen a perl script capable of generating fake research papers that was used to create at least papers that were accepted at scientific conferences van noorden these false papers mimicry merits consideration as a metaphorical stance because the formula implicitly critiques the jargony formulaic writing of computer science research since these papers are nominally attributed to human authors they are inversely related to books with putatively procedural origins other projects in this operationalist genre demonstrate that a nuanced and even ambiguous relationship may persist among a human and their authoring process without committing false attribution the seeker thricedotted is a well known example of a project where an implied author complicates the stakes of attribution by managing to achieve something like intersubjectivity in the creativity code marcus du sautoy writes the seeker almost works as a novel unlike many other algorithmic creations because we start to feel we are getting inside the head of the algorithm as it tries to make sense of humans in keeping with the norms of nanogenmo thricedotted has shared the source code for the project but appreciating the novel s fictional and poetic operations are much more compelling than scrutinizing the mechanics of its code a more recent nanogenmo book places such an emphasis on the mechanics of its operations that it becomes a meditation on the intimate yet unknowable micro mechanics of speaking simple dialogues garbier and zhang tells the story of a man ordering coffee but the text we read breaks each spoken word into its phonetic elements and describes the physical movements necessary to create those sounds barista raises the back of her tongue towards the hard part of the roof of her mouth neither too far forward nor too far back she keeps some space between her tongue and the roof of her mouth with her vocal folds tensed she releases air through her mouth she rounds her lips so that they create a small opening with her tongue in a relaxed position at the back of her mouth she tightens her vocal folds and releases air through her mouth the result is creepy and almost erotic in the context of the year when any conversation like the one narrated would take place with both speakers mouths hidden behind masks like metaphoric works discussed above the concept of simple dialogues is relatively easy to express in a short sentence and it is very readable but the operation of the process it uses to direct attention toward another process draws our aesthetic attention to the logic of its processes other notable books in this operationalist genre include the road by ross goodwin and karen ann donnachie and andy simionato the library of nonhuman books nick montfort has created several computer generated books which convey operationalist interest and in most cases montfort has shared the source code either within the book or on his website for some of these projects like world clock the code is relatively easy to follow and even if it weren t the operations of the code are deducible from the structure of the text as it writes its way around the world in other cases like the poems in montfort s poetry collection the source code for each poem is printed alongside a sample run of its output some of these programs especially those in the ppg series are written so compactly that much of their pleasure comes in detangling their operations to see how they could produce the output ascribed to them leonardo flores in a critical code studies working group thread appropriates the metaphorically spatial interpretive strategies close and distant reading to distinguish degrees of distance between programmers and the data of their programs in computer generated writing flores in flores formulation many of montfort s programs would demonstrate short distance writing by working with the literal and phonetic elements of language or medium distance writing by working with one or just a few well demarcated datasets but in all of these distances the writing that flores refers to encompasses both the data and the operational aesthetics of the program manipulating that data into poetry or prose i argue additionally that montfort is creating a nuanced and complex position for authorial subjectivity by in at least some cases sharing code that expresses the operations of the program in language that is difficult to read at least for me of course the first audience for a code poem is the programming language that compiles and carries out its instructions so montfort s minified instructions muster creativity in programming to address the quotidian operations of our every day computer not some mystically sentient ghost in a machine the only computer generated book by montfort that plays with obscurity in a self evident way is his recent book golem the novel includes novel generating code two perl scripts but as i write in my postword to golem neither of these scripts are capable of generating the text on reads in the first place in this case the distances between the implied code the latent original code and the inscribed code diegetically understood by the censor and written by charlie create a rich ambiguity around the implied author of the book golem is not a hoax or fraud but its mysteries challenge readers to reverse engineer its operations operational interest may be evident in any computer generated book but for those where an author attribution is dubious or complex or where the mechanisms of generation are conceptually important to the meaning of the work referring to these works as operationalist in nature places their signifying strategies into an ecosystem of textual reception at the same time these works that foreground their process or create intrigue by obscuring it help underscore the problem with the ready availability of plausible word goo from openai s gpt and gpt where the mechanism is proprietary and the results tend to be at best locally quirky and at worst deeply problematic fiction or the meanings of computer generated books in this paper i have described three types of computer generated books metonymic books that work in reference to the medium of books as a whole metaphoric books that relate to specific other texts or genres and operationalist books that invite readers to investigate speculate or reflect on the processes used to create the book each of these categories can be thought of as genres in the sense that each has distinguishing features and characteristic purposes for their constituent examples still these types are rather broad and in some cases the subjective heuristics i use may seem normative or arbitrary with the few examples i have included in this paper there are undoubtedly many computer generated books without a clear generic fit i can think of at least one more genre of computer generated books instrumentalist books like textbooks created by scraping wikipedia and as some of the examples demonstrate any computer generated books may have features consistent with two or more of the types i have specified here but given the wide range and long history of books authored or co authored by computational processes this attempt at a framework for describing their purposes and audiences helps is a step toward contextualizing these works of electronic literature within
