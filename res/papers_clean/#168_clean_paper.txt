language h as a virus from figure of thought to experimental laboratory diogo marques ana gago university of coimbra centre of portuguese literature catholic university of portugal research centre for science and technology of the arts i have frequently spoken of word and image as viruses or as acting as viruses and this is not an allegorical comparison william s burroughs if the computer virus is a technological phenomenon cloaked in the metaphor of biology emerging infectious diseases are a biological phenomenon cloaked in the technological paradigm as with computer viruses emerging infectious diseases constitute an example of a counterprotocol phenomenon alexander galloway and eugene thacker the exploit modernism is a history of infections by political movements by mass culture and consumerism and now by the internet information technology and interactivity the openness to exteriority and its infections is an essential characteristic of the modernist inheritance and that inheritance is the will to reveal the other within oneself to become other to become infected by otherness boris groys in the flow from linguistic inflection to artistic infection in plague and the athenian imagination robin mitchell boyask considers the hypothesis of the athens plague being responsible for the ways in which greek tragedies were to be performed after bce according to mitchell boyask not only the experience of living in a city ravaged by the plague was reflected in its discourse the adjacency of the asklepieion to the theater of dionysus was an important part of their performative environment after and the construction of the asklepieion itself was part of the athenian reaction to the plague in order to sustain his argument mitchell boyask refers to history of the peloponnesian war a narrative in which the greek historian thucydides gives a very detailed textual account with regard to the effects of the plague in athens far from being easy and full of rhetorical devices in every known translation of it the greek used by thucydides is subject to new mutations of the original strain nonetheless in its essence from the description of symptoms and ways of contagion to the process of creating immunity through its description the plague of athens seems to hold more or less what characterizes every single pandemic namely the ways in which physical malaise quickly begins to be confused with social malaise being a text known for its blurring of boundaries when it comes to genre categorizations naturally language might have something to do with it for instance the ways in which words are interpreted as subject to mutations in fact the very word pestilence such then was the calamity that had befallen them by which the athenians were sore pressed their people dying within the walls and their land being ravaged without and in their distress they recalled as was natural the following verse which their older men said had long ago been uttered a dorian war shall come and pestilence with it a dispute arose however among the people some contending that the word used in the verse by the ancients was not λοιμός pestilence but λιμός famine and the view prevailed at the time that pestilence was the original word and quite naturally for men s recollections conformed to their sufferings our emphasis from sophocles king oedipus to boccaccio s decameron shakespeare s king lear or daniel defoe s a journal of the plague year the experience of different pandemics by these and other authors seems to add other layers of meaning to william burroughs reflections on language as a virus namely in their variations changes ambiguities errors accidents and or mutations in the s burroughs was mainly thinking of the ways in which writing as a technology is an alien virus that goes undetected because it has a perfect symbiosis with its host if we are to recognize that language and viruses coexist with the experience and repercussion of every single pandemic to what extent the concept of virality may suffer a new mutation by influence of covid most particularly one that is specifically connected to digital media and the internet in his book in the flow boris groys elaborates on kazimir malevich s idea of infection among several art styles such as cubism and suprematism comparing the straight lines of suprematism to the rectilinear organic form known as the bacillus of tuberculosis just as the latter is able to modify its body groys tells us how malevich is able to describe the ways in which novel visual elements introduced into the world by new technical and social developments modify the sensibility and nervous system of the artist however from the moment he applies the trope of biological evolution to artists and the teaching of arts malevich subverts the logic of immunization inherent to the whole metaphor this way instead of incorporating new aesthetic bacilli to survive them and find a new inner balance a new definition of health artists should not immunize themselves against these bacilli but on the contrary accept them and let them to destroy the old traditional art patterns consequently the body of the artist may die but the bacilli survive that death and begin to infect the bodies of other artists that is why malevich actually believes in the transhistorical character of art art is material and materialist and that means that art can always survive the end of all the purely idealist metaphysical projects whether kingdom of god or communism the idea of hijacking the whole logic of the immune system of arts and artists is not far from the ways in which computer viruses and digital virality came to be understood in the word used by thucydides is anomía ἀνομία ας absence of law rule order or legality ἀ deprivation negation νόμος law rule in a description that seems placing phýsis above nómos the laws of nature for example hedonistic pleasure above other types of laws or conventions digital contagion jussi parikka highlights that the notion of viral is infectious to the point of expanding into various contexts from cybernetics and computing to biology literature television cinema and media art including philosophical theory and cyber theory in the s but differently from malevich s metaphors of biological bacilli applied to arts parikka s discussion on viruses goes well beyond the allegorical suggesting that the digital virus is becoming biological and that ultimately the biological deterritorializes and reterritorializes across different texts and contexts knight n p being reminiscent of this article s initial epigraph this layer of literalization that goes beyond its metaphorical meaning makes us think of affinities in this sense while the notion of virus is a trope of contagion that infects contaminates and mutates from the moment it became associated by affinity with digital media it underwent a state of becoming biological to use parikka s expression ending in a current state of an in between meaning that as a permeable trope through that in between status the word virus acts as an interface along different fields of knowledge consequently enabling transdisciplinarity and ultimately the internet a space suitable to the spread of contagion and transversal propagation of movement from computer viruses to ideas and affects terranova as quoted in parikka xxiv is the perfect ecosystem presenting ideal conditions for the propagation of these rhizomatic reactions through language not just understood as communication or about thinking but a force that materially connects rhizomatically with its outside computer viruses are subject to various assemblages of enunciation such as mass media acts as such harmful viruses can mean malicious software a security problem but also a piece of net art an artificial life project or a potentially beneficial utility program xxviii xxix a complex definition that is not far from the ways in which virologists mario mietzsch and mavis agbandje mckenna talk of the good that viruses do understanding the potential of viruses for the development of useful biologics with therapeutic benefits to humans accordingly for them if a survey were to ask nonvirologists for their opinions about viruses the word good would be unlikely to arise instead words such as disease infection suffering or life threatening would likely dominate as people primarily think of viruses such as hiv ebola virus zika virus influenza virus or whatever new outbreak is in the news however as we are now finding out not all viruses are detrimental to human health in fact some viruses have beneficial properties for their hosts in a symbiotic relationship while other natural and laboratory modified viruses can be used to target and kill cancer cells to treat a variety of genetic diseases as gene and cell therapy tools or to serve as vaccines or vaccine delivery agents in biology a measure of the attraction of one biological molecule toward another molecule either to modify it destroy it or form a compound with it examples of it being enzymes and their substrates or antibodies and their antigens https www genscript com molecular biology glossary affinity accessed may the idea of the good virus is not limited to virology however in the exploit an experimental volume made of nodes and edges alexander galloway and eugene thacker explore the ways in which the good virus concept is transversal to a series of domains central to their argument is the notion of networks understood as aggregate interconnections of dissimilar subnetworks published in this volume by galloway and thacker already anticipates what would later become a pandemic in fact their analysis is so anticipatory of the effects that we are now experiencing to the point of being almost indistinguishable specifically when it comes to understand sars as a new virology of globalization and its associated transgression of boundaries the sars virus for instance crosses the species boundaries when it jumps from animals to humans it also crosses national boundaries in its travels between china canada the united states and southeast asia it crosses economic boundaries affecting the air travel industry tourism and entertainment industries as well as providing initiative and new markets for pharmaceutical corporations finally it crosses the nature artifice boundary in that it draws together viruses organisms computers databases and the development of vaccines its tactic is the flood an age old network antagonism largely derived from general systems theory galloway and thacker s amplification of the principles governing networks enables them to state that when it comes to infectious diseases they take advantage of a range of networks many of them human made biological networks of humans and animals transportation networks communications networks media networks and sociocultural networks in this sense m edia and sociocultural networks can work as much in favor of the virus as against it witness the pervasive media hype that surrounds any public health news concerning emerging infectious diseases nonetheless if in galloway and thacker s understanding of the potentially nefarious effects of media and sociocultural networks came in association with the fear of bioterrorism in in the midst of a pandemic it became linked to the so called post truth era namely a populism and authoritarianism marked by waves of misinformation as a network that congregates and to some extent paradoxically im materializes many other subnetworks communications information socio cultural networks the infectious possibilities of internet seem evident what possibilities remain then for good

project in its surviving unfinished version the atlas mnemosyne consisted of a series of panels composed of more than drawings prints newspaper clippings and photographic reproductions of paintings sculptures and everyday objects focusing on the renaissance period but drawing patterns of a visual continuity from ancient greece to the republic of weimar this fractal like montage displayed warburg s attempt of representing two often dueling types of responses to psychological and emotional events as described in the draft introduction einleitung to the atlas the first being a dionysian reactive and phobic kinetic and the second an apollonian more reflective and artistically contained type of response newman hatch n p fig atlas mnemosyne panel nymph hurry bring it in tornabuoni circle domestication credits the warburg institute cornell university https warburg library cornell edu https warburg library cornell edu image group panel introduction accessed may one of the particularities of the atlas mnemosyne is the way in which warburg applied the concept of bewegtes leben life in motion or animated life to artistic images exploring the idea of gebärdensprache language of gesture as an earlier type of pathosformel pathos formula composed by emotionally charged visual tropes that were directly transmitted from the antiquity by renaissance artists by doing so as didi huberman describes in the surviving image the author experiments on the possibility of assembling an atlas or one could say a network of archetypal forms of knowledge memory and desire in forming western psycho emotional history to this warburg replies simply that images do not call solely upon vision they do at first call upon the act of looking but also upon knowledge memory and desire and upon their capacity which is always available of intensification this already means that they involve the subject in its totality sensorial psychological and social didi huberman in this sense just like malevich warburg analyses artistic images through the contemplation of their materiality and transhistorical nature but unlike the former associating it with its ability to intensify sensorial and psychological experiences as well as to generate meaning following warburg s psychoanalytic and iconographic approach it is possible to identify some of the themes or archetypes enunciated by the atlas mnemosyne in aiq s galleries more precisely the tensions and dualities encapsulated in these pathos charged representations of the pandemic experience for instance pathos formulas of sacrifice and triumph order and chaos anger and resignation ecstasy and melancholy and often abstraction more or less exuberant or humoristic as a response mechanism to fear or to what warburg would call loss of the how of metaphor hönes n p or invisible and incomprehensible threat alongside their corresponding visual and sound trope like motifs the contrast between inside and outside life transparency and opacity windows and screens stillness and movement noise and silence greyness and vividness of colours animistic and geometrical representations of the virus lack of recognizable explanations when facing an another relevant aspect is the way in which artistic representations are indeed permeated by digital media aesthetics and apparatus confirming the idea that digitality and mediates every single aspect of this pandemic falling under the spectrum of electronic literature the panel of three selected artworks to be further analysed and regardless of their fractal nature function as organisms that are part of a specific subnetwork or population in their self reflective nature revealing language as a form of virus in itself these artworks act as distinctive virus strains that make distinct uses of different programming and poetic languages for artistic purposes a mobile screen capture performance a generative online memorial and a software

transmit meaning acting both as a medium and a significant of its own i e acting like other cultural technological artifacts mediators which assume a symbiotic behaviour in regard to their non human host similarly in applying the idea of life in motion to artistic images aby warburg was profoundly influenced by the technological production of his time namely the advances in chromatography dynamography and the seismograph as didi huberman points out in the surviving image warburg s notions of the pathosformel and the dynamogramm presuppose an energetic and dynamic conception of the trace which is viewed as a reflexive prolongation of the organic movements mediated however by a stylus style a word that must be understood in its technical sense as well as in the aesthetic sense furthermore warburg would compare his own work as an historian to that of a seismograph when trying to decode and translate the pathological shockwaves of historical events amongst his own interior experience of the event the symptom being that the seismic action also necessarily affects the device itself making it empathically tremble demonstrating parikka s view on the internet himself a effectively infected by terranova the aiq project is representative of an optimal ecosystem for the propagation of movement often with a special emphasis on bottom up emergence xvii namely by taking
