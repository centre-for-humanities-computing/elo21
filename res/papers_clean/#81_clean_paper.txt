english versification for the billion translating the early latin poetry generator artificial versifying kaeden berg henry koelling and james ryan studio for computational media archaeology carleton college northfield minnesota united states bergk koellingh jryan carleton edu abstract among the more remarkable antecedents to electronic literature is a little known system for latin poetry generation that was published in by its inventor john peter in a booklet titled artificial versifying to generate a line of verse the user produces a random number by which a sequence of words may be retrieved from tables containing scrambled letters improbably peter s strange invention was quite successful the booklet appeared in three editions and the system was republished in various periodicals over the subsequent two centuries in this paper we present the first translation into english of this remarkable work critically our translation is of the system as a whole as opposed to individual outputs or isolated components in discussing our translation experience we connect to the emerging scholarship on e lit translation and echo earlier findings in that area these resonances we contend demonstrate that the peculiar considerations inherent in the translation of electronic literature are already present in protocomputational works that are sufficiently procedural such as john peter s artificial versifying kaeden berg henry koelling and james ryan english versification for the billion translating the early latin poetry generator artificial versifying proceedings of the electronic literature organization conference elo berg koelling and ryan introduction in the middle s perhaps amid the great plague of london a physician and polymath named john peter developed a peculiar system allowing for the pro cedural generation of latin poetry a decade later in peter s system was published in a landmark booklet titled artificial versifying whose subtitle pro claimed that anyone that only knows the a b c and can count could use its system to produce true latin true verse and good sense the system itself centers on a set of six versifying tables in which letters are distributed across grids of cells to generate a line of poetry the user first produces a string of six digits e g next each digit is used to retrieve a sequence of letters from the table corresponding to that digit s position in the string the letters obtained in this way will form one of nine words contained in that table and the concatena tion of the six chosen words constitutes a line of latin verse in dactylic hexameter given that each table contains nine words peter s system is capable of generating i e or lines of verse figure includes the original tables along with a more detailed description of the procedure as a bizarre forerunner of electronic literature artificial versifying was wildly successful the booklet appeared in three or four editions and its procedure was reprinted in books and periodicals for the next years sadly peter s innovative system has received scant treatment by scholars working today of particular note is ruff who provides the most extensive treatment binder interprets artificial versifying in relation to a history of the algorithm as a cultural construct he has also produced a remarkable computerization of the system binder koch was likely the first to identify artificial versifying as a precursor to electronic literature more recently both swidzinski and rodgers a b have situated peter s system against swift s famous engine from gulliver s travels and also the later eureka a physical machine constructed in the s that generated latin verse see blandford hall hall brief mentions also appear in van der lee et al and henrickson this limited coverage of artificial versifying is incommensurate to its importance as berg koelling and ryan figure the title page of the first edition of artificial versifying published by john sims in london in curiously this edition does not identify the author john peter to whose same hand the second edition is attributed berg koelling and ryan a groundbreaking work produced centuries ahead of its time indeed its specific combinatorial method prefigures much of the early computer poetry such as theo lutz s stochastische texte lutz bernhart and allison knowles and james tenney s a house of dust knowles et al buchloh to better our own understanding and to spur more critical engagement with peter s work we have carried out the first translation into english of the artificial versifying system while it is relatively trivial to translate any one of its possible outputs we sought instead to translate the system itself into english ul timately this only entailed translating each of the words in the six tables but the process has nonetheless raised a number of interesting challenges the ma jor difficulty is in preserving both meaning and meter peter s system produces hexameter verse specifically though we identified additional dimensions of the original system that we sought to maintain in turn in wrangling the interrelations between these features at the level of a combinatorial space our design consider ations were akin to those that structured peter s invention while a core aim of this process has been to make artificial versifying accessible to non latin speakers today our translation has helped us to better appreciate the triumph of its design broadly we situate our project amid emerging scholarship on the challenges and opportunities of translating electronic literature this subarea of translation studies bassnett called e lit translation is perhaps best characterized by the renderings project carried out by nick montfort piotr marecki and other collaborators in the last decade montfort and fedorova małecka and marecki campana et al montfort and interest in the area is growing e g regnauld and abrioux cayley pisarski pold et al montfort raley and mitchell bouchardon and meza bouchardon pisarski we briefly review this work in the next section in this paper we present our english translation of the artificial versifying system which may be used to procedurally generate english verse in the style of peter s original latin outputs as we explain at length below we have in fact produced a series of translation candidates culminating in what we treat as our berg koelling and ryan figure the versifying tables from the first edition of john peter s artificial versifying to generate a line of verse from them first produce a string of six digits each between one and nine e g next take the first digit and the first table and retrieve from that table the letter in the cell corresponding to the difference between nine and that digit for instance using a first digit of one would select the sixth letter in the first table which is h if the digit is retrieve the ninth letter now repeatedly advance in the table by nine cells retrieving the letters at those positions until a black square is encountered the table proceeds left to right top to bottom concatenate the retrieved letters to form the first word in the verse now repeat this process for each digit table pair and combine the resulting six words to form a hexameter verse as one example using the input one procedurally generates the verse turbida ella malis producunt pignora tantum meaning for the evil messy wars create only promises note that the tables are simply word banks whose items are obfuscated by being interleaved such that the characters composing each word are spread nine cells apart from one another once a word is finished the corresponding cell is filled in black to indicate that the word is finished in the case of especially short words additional unneeded cells after a terminating black square are filled with a random letter likely to further obfuscate the generation method given that each table contains nine words peter s system can produce i e or lines of verse berg koelling and ryan final translation each of which makes particular commitments to certain features of the original that are to be maintained generally such commitments are in compatible with one another which means there is no optimal policy of course this is the essential problem of translation but we will argue that such troubles are amplified in the case of translating a system as opposed to a static text in doing so we echo earlier findings by montfort and others thereby demonstrating that the peculiar considerations inherent in the translation of electronic literature are already present in protocomputational works that are sufficiently procedural such as artificial versifying we hope that our work will stimulate interest in pe ter s unheralded project and also in the translation of other protocomputational works that have anticipated electronic literature in interesting ways translating electronic literature for space reasons in this section we will only touch upon the growing area of e lit translation see montfort for a nice overview with a particular emphasis on the core notions that we echo below with regard to our translation of artificial versifying while we have discovered a number of contemporaneous translations of early computer poetry these are cases of translated outputs not translated sys tems early examples of the latter include the translations of michael joyce s af ternoon a story joyce grigar into italian vannini and german köhler and krause though this hypertext work does not employ procedural generation in helen maccormac translated lutz into english and thereby effectively translated his poetry generator in that she produced english versions of the word banks that drive the system maccormac did not computerize her translation however and she does not appear to have discussed her translation process one catalyst for scholarly interest in the translation of electronic litera ture was the translating e literature conference held in paris in regnauld and abrioux and many contributions have appeared since e g cayley pisarski pold et al montfort raley and mitchell bouchardon and meza bouchardon pisarski with the aforemen berg koelling and ryan tioned renderings project providing a through line montfort and fedorova małecka and marecki campana et al montfort a fundamental notion in this literature is that e lit translation adds to the translator s burden the trouble of maintaining features of the source work at the level of a possibility space see karth rather than a static text as glazier puts it the introduction of such procedurality has the effect of adding lubricant to the already slippery slope of the location of meaning and there s more than just meaning to maintain montfort identifies among other dimensions the metrical material and contextual all of which are present in conventional translation but exacerbated by what he calls the computational aspect n p that inheres in e lit in the case of a work like artificial versifying a given verse is sampled from the possibility space its generable outputs by carrying out the combinatorial procedure that recombines its words as translators our task is to translate these words so as to maintain the salient features of the original space of verses this pits us most painfully against what cayley calls local algorithmic dissonance the work may address by way of its own algorithmic processes and make implicit assumptions about the grammar of its particular original language and these may not work gram matically in the host language n p as we explain at length below peter s word banks are constructed in a way that relies on aspects of latin that are not present in english these function in the system as critical though implicit apparatus but we had to reinvent english corollaries to make our translation work we contend that our project s indirect wrangling of system dynamics through the manipulation of system components is one expression of montfort s compu tational aspect of e lit translation of course artificial versifying is not compu tational it predates even babbage s analytical engine menabrea and lovelace by a century and a half in identifying the computational aspect montfort quotes cayley who notes the making of certain linguistic artifacts the ones germane to e lit translation cannot be achieved without digital media and digital affordances n p we contend that it is not a digital materiality or even a berg koelling and ryan computational mechanism that underpins the computational aspect that compli cates e lit translation rather these challenges are already present in any textual artifact that is sufficiently procedural showing this through our case study of translating artificial versifying is this paper s contribution to e lit translation translating artificial versifying in the course of our translation effort we produced a succession of translation candidates each of which resulted from a particular policy that aimed to preserve specific aspects or dimensions of the original broadly we identified two primary dimensions meaning and meter and a handful of secondary dimensions such as grammaticality whether the translated outputs are grammatical in the host language interface whether the user experience is preserved system internal features number of word banks order of the word banks number of items in each bank item bank associations whether there are multiword items input output relationship whether e g in the translated system produces a transla tion of the output for in the original system and superficial features the degree to which our tables resemble the original tables in our conception pri mary dimensions are ones to which a translation policy can deeply commit while secondary dimensions work to structure smaller decisions throughout the process while it s possible to preserve both meaning and meter in certain individual out puts doing so for the entire system i e the space of outputs is not possible as we explain below using specific examples as such the meaning and meter dimensions are inherently at odds in this translation problem which allows for three fundamental policies in total aggressive meaning preservation aggressive meter preservation and meaning meter compromise in this section we discuss our translation experience in terms of a progres sion through these policies in order and specifically three translation candidates that instantiated them our third and final candidate which we identify as our translation of artificial versifying strikes a compromise between meaning and in tracing this meter preservation with attention to a few secondary features berg koelling and ryan progression we identify particular issues that emerged along with our attempts to ameliorate them table and table show our three translation candidates i e translations of all words which respectively instantiate aggressive meaning preservation aggressive meter preservation and meaning meter compromise trans lation policies see figure for the actual presentation of our final translation in the form of english versifying tables to be clear our translation is specifically of the system presented in the first edition of artificial versifying published in the second and third editions include revised hexameter tables as well as pentameter tables and these remain to be translated background meter in artificial versifying as we have noted above the artificial versifying system relies on six tables each containing nine latin words by using a random number to select one item from each table a line of verse is formed a fundamental characteristic of the system is that the latin verse that it generates is in dactylic hexameter cuddon which is a famous metrical scheme that is associated with both greek and latin epic poetry such as homer s odyssey and virgil s aeneid in the scheme each line of verse consists of six feet each of which is either a dactyl spondee or anceps a dactyl is a foot containing three syllables the first being a long syllable and the second and third being short syllables for example the word tristia is a dactyl we emphasize the syllable trist but not i or a examples of english dactyls include this is the and murmuring a spondee then is a foot with two syllables that are both emphasized for example in the latin verb portabunt the two syllables a and bunt form a spondee because both are long an anceps is the final foot in the line of hexameter and contains two syllables the first is long and the second can either be long or short finally a metrical pattern instantiated in a particular verse is called its scansion before moving on we ll note a metrical quirk of peter s original versifying ta bles while all the words from a given table generally have the same scansion this is not the case in table this table contains two words aliis for others and berg koelling and ryan inquam i say that do not conform to the scansion of the other seven words in the table unlike the other words these two create an elision when combined with any word from the first table this is when a word phonetically blends into the word preceding it because both begin with a vowel while all the words in table end with a vowel as a result the first syllable in each of these words is not pro nounced altering the rhythm of the dactylic hexameter from dactyl dactyl spondee spondee dactyl anceps to dactyl spondee spondee spondee dactyl anceps as an illustration here are two diagrams show ing the distinction between the respective scansions of pessima verba vides promit tunt fœdera certa i see horrible words that promise certain pacts and pessima verba aliis promittunt fœdera certa for others horrible words promise certain pacts pessima verba vides promittunt fœdera certa pessima verba aliis promittunt fœdera certa an unstressed syllable indicates a stressed syllable in this notation an anceps and the ending of a foot as the diagrams show the addition of aliis triggers an elision with the previous word verba which changes the second foot into a spondee rather than a dactyl this is marked by the curved line connecting verba and aliis in the bottom diagram while we did not attempt to capture elision in our translation it is an interesting characteristic of the system that we thought worth mentioning policy aggressive meaning preservation our first translation candidate focused solely on preserving the literal meaning of the latin but without resorting to aggressive measures such as reordering the versifying tables it is shown in table and table to produce this candidate we started with the latin word banks extracted from peter s versifying tables by ruff and then used university of chicago s logeion resource berg koelling and ryan original latin word pessima turpia horrida tristia turbida aspera sordida impia perfida dona

definite different numerous regular t table variant translations for the original latin words in the latter three versifying tables of artificial versifying this is a continuation of table berg koelling and ryan goldenberg and shanahan to generate additional potential translations for each word upon comparing our generated list to ruff s translation choices we compiled a final list containing options that adequately captured meaning and also seemed amenable to combination with the other selected word translations two words in particular were difficult to translate dicta things having been said and facta things having been finished both facta and dicta can function as nominative accusative plural nouns or past perfect participles in peter s original outputs they serve variously as the subject direct object or past perfect participle of the sentence for example the sentence turbida facta mihi promittunt tempora tantum translates to disordered deeds for me promise times only when we treat facta as the subject but it could alternatively be translated to disordered times for me promise deeds only by treating facta as a direct object or disordered things having been finished for me promise times only by treating facta as a past perfect participle each of these translations are entirely plausible which blows up the space of generable meanings when we consider all the contexts in which facta and dicta may appear the english language doesn t have an elegant way of representing this flexibility ruff who was simply providing glosses for each word in the system chose to present these as nouns words for dicta and deeds for facta this translation loses some semantic nuance as words doesn t fully convey the idea of past conversations we instead translated it as remarks which we view as closer to the original meaning generally the flexible word order in latin permits multiple valid translations for a given output for example the input gives us aspera fata inquam monstrabunt pignora certa a direct transliteration might produce bitter fates i say will show wagers certain however alternative translations include i say that certain fates will show bitter wagers i say that bitter wagers will show certain fates or even i say that certain bitter wagers will show fates each noun can serve either as the subject or direct object of the line and the adjectives can modify either noun the word certa could also function as an adverb in this case instead of an adjective it is more common for the first noun to be the subject in latin berg koelling and ryan verse so for our translations we pick the first word to be subject unfortunately there is no way to preserve both this flexibility and system internal features if we are to translate these tables into english other languages that have flexible word order such as polish or portuguese might allow for more faithful translations than english in an experimental attempt to capture this flexibility we prototyped a simple program that would carry out the artificial versifying procedure and then postprocess each generated line of english verse by randomizing the position of certain components to capture the syntactic flexibility of the original while this worked decently the resulting procedure strayed too far from the original generation method and it wasn t clear how we d incorporate it into a non computerized interface therefore our subsequent translation policies were carried out with word order enforced solely through the ordering of the tables if we wished to alter word order we would have to re arrange the tables since preserving the original generation method is just as important to our project as translating the words themselves this is the interface dimension this initial translation candidate did not produce hexameter verse a funda mental goal of our project and furthermore it failed to capture meaning ade quately as we ll discuss in the section below about our final translation pol icy table internal inconsistencies with regard to part of speech make even a loose transliteration futile for instance table includes both adjectives and adverbs which in latin can both serve as postmodifiers in english however this leads to outputs such as the disloyal laws i think promise seasons lone one option is swap ping tables and but this would then produce outputs such as the dishonest gift you see encourage clearly verdicts here both the meaning and the grammat icality dimensions are not handled well translating any given output on its own is trivial but in a combinatorial system like artificial versifying each decision in a given translation affects thousands and thousands of other translations while latin s freer word order generally challenges translation into english the issue is exacerbated here due to the combinatorics inherent in peter s system montfort s computational aspect rears its head berg koelling and ryan policy aggressive meter preservation for our second translation candidate we took on an alternative policy that aimed to aggressively preserve the poetic meter used by john peter first we note that while latin hexameter is often translated into english as iambic pentameter this is not always the case e g see gray and we sought to preserve the specific hexameter scansion of the original to do this we tried to translate each of the latin words into english such that the number of syllables matched for example we translated the table adjective pessima to pathetic problems arose when translating verbs from table in the system s original outputs each verb from the fourth table completes the third foot and then fully constitutes the fourth foot of the verse all by using its three stressed syllables but in english there are few words that are naturally pronounced with three stressed syllables let alone verbs while latin uses vowel length to create poetic rhythm english verse tends to use stressed and unstressed syllables to assign meter and rhythm this is in part because the english language has an unreliable vowel length system where vowel length can change with the meaning of the word and differences in regional dialects further complicate assigning accurate length to derive more robust met rical interpretations for our word candidates based on vowel stress we consulted phoneticizations in american english in international phonetic alphabet ipa format international phonetic association here our goal was to identify word candidates whose vowel stresses corresponded to the vowel lengths of the associated latin words long to stressed short to unstressed while this isn t an ideal conversion vowel strength is more reliable than vowel length in english and we found that this method generated in our translated verses a similar rhythm to the original latin outputs our main work in instantiating this policy involved poring over our the list of syllable matched words to identify which words violated our strength based meter for each word needing replacement we tested possible synonyms and analyzed their vowel strength patterns for most words this was a quick process but there were a few trouble spots in table peter uses the latin words reor i think berg koelling and ryan inquam i say and scio i know as iambs stressed unstressed to fill out the last unstressed syllable of the second dactyl these three are verbs which complicates the translation because in latin the verb form is partially based on the subject and therefore the subject is often redundant and excluded to convert these into proper english we have to reintroduce the subject i in these cases as the verbs are first person singular in english i is a stressed vowel as such introducing the subject i means those three elements cannot be iambs because any one syllable verb following i will always itself be stressed such intervention therefore breaks our meter we struggled to find an elegant solution to this until our final translation where we swapped table with another to both better match the latin meter and improve along the grammaticality dimension similarly the datives require a multi word translation into english to preserve the meaning we needed to supply a preposition before the noun for example viro would be translated as for man while our second translation candidate faithfully preserved meter the outputs that it produces violate the grammaticality dimension to the point of severely disrupting meaning for instance pitiable presents to them will create periods destined though we were reticent to do so since it would violate the system internal features and input output relationship dimensions we determined that it would be necessary to reorder our versifying tables policy meaning meter compromise to adequately preserve both meaning and meter we would have to make some drastic trade offs while our previous translation candidate was missing the mark this was partially a fault of the original latin verse artificial versifying s outputs aren t guaranteed to be proper sentences rather many of the outputs comprise two syntactically disjoint three word sentences with an implied connection for example i know pitiable words will certainly display seasons is a syntactically well formed english sentence but its latin counterpart pessima verba scio mon strabunt certa tempora is grammatically incorrect in classical latin the use of reor berg koelling and ryan i think inquam i say or scio i know in tandem with another verb in the sen tence implies an indirect statement as in i know that pitiable words will display certain seasons but that is not what latin grammar dictates in latin indirect statements require an infinitive verb and an accusative subject though the nouns chosen by peters have a form that could be accusative there are no infinitive verbs in the tables instead we have two sentence fragments to use an english exam ple the syntax of the previous example causes it to read something like i know pitiable words seasons certainly will display though the latin grammar results in two sentence fragments peter intends for such examples to read as single lines via parataxis to capture this in english we treated these three verbs as introduc ing an indirect statement e g i know that pitiable words will display certain seasons even though this does not maintain the awkward fragmentation of the original latin though this peculiar syntax sort of works in latin its preservation in english would have resulted in nonsense while relying on indirect statements maintained grammaticality of our out puts further problems arose as we noted above english has a stricter word order than latin with adjectives generally directly preceding nouns and adverbs tending to appear adjacently to the verbs they modify in artificial versifying the sixth table exclusively contains adverbs and adjectives and as a result each output ends with one of these parts of speech if the order of the tables was to be preserved to maintain the system internal features and input output relationship dimensions the resulting outputs would be ungrammatical for example bois terous phrases i think do affirm pledges lonely and boisterous phrases i think do affirm pledges many in our final translation candidate which instantiates a meaning meter compromise policy we swapped table with table while we hoped that repositioning the adverbs to immediately follow verbs would help the translation candidate still produced bad outputs such as splenetic mentions i know do dictate totally edicts this demonstrated that it would be necessary not only to swap table and table but to dramatically alter the contents of the original table as well berg koelling and ryan toward this we attempted to turn the adverbs into corresponding adjectives while maintaining some semblance of the original meanings this was an incredibly difficult task especially given the additional metrical constraints we focused on the relationship between the verb from table and the noun from table to produce these pseudo synonyms as one example we had to convert the adverb sæpe often again into an adjective for which we produced regular to give the table nouns modified by the word a sense of being periodic or expected this worked fairly well e g for me boisterous phrases will produce regular battles finally the verbs and datives in table didn t fit into the meter properly and to produce an indirect statement they had to be at the front of the sentence to fix both issues we swapped table with table causing an output like traitorous words you know will create only the edicts to become you know traitorous words will create only the edicts doing so drastically improved the readability of the outputs but it altered the scansion as our translations of the items in the original table were now spondees while peter s items were dactyls this necessitated that the words in table be translated so as to each comprise a single stressed syllable to constitute the first syllable of the third foot we also produced a few translated items that do not match the scansion of their counterparts in the same table namely tarnished in table just those in table and ideas in table this does not deviate from dactylic hexamater however and we note that peter s original outputs scanned in different ways as we explained above discussion we made several concessions in our final translation candidate to maintain the interface dimension we gave up the flexibility of the ambiguous noun adjective pairings and decided that the first noun is always the subject in support of meaning and grammatically we rearranged the versifying tables to accommodate english s stricter word order we also converted all the original adverbs into adjec tives that only captured some of the semantic nuances of the former as a balance between meaning and meter we were a bit looser with scansion than peter was berg koelling and ryan in his original tables these changes produced outputs that maintain meaning to a fair degree while still preserving the dactylic hexameter of the original latin verses unfortunately the shuffling of the tables totally violates the input output relationship dimension in our first two translation candidates any input to the original artificial versifying would produce a corresponding english translation when submitted to our versifying tables this relationship is unfortunately lost in our final translation given our reordering of the tables for instance the out put for input in peter s original system now corresponds to the output for in our english translation of the system relatedly the system internal features dimension is harmed because one such feature is the order of the versify ing tables we did however abstain from swapping words between tables which was one option that we had considered critically our final translation candi date does quite well in terms of grammaticality which was not true of our initial candidates we believe that this is worth the cost of these other two secondary dimensions additionally none of our design choices compromised our ability to maintain peter s peculiar interface as we discuss next the final presentation of our translation comes in the form of a new set of six versifying tables which are compatible with peter s original procedure for verse generation in the end we are quite pleased with our english translation of artificial versi fying with our process having now concluded we believe that we have produced a least bad translation which is what we can reasonably pursue in the challenging space of e lit translation final presentation a faithful translation of the artificial versifying system should preserve its inter face dimension and toward this the final presentation of our english translation takes the form of a set of six versifying tables with which hexameter verse may be generated using the same procedure that peter invented over four centuries ago this presentation is given in figure one distinction in our tables is the inclusion of blank white squares to represent spaces within items retrieved from a table this berg koelling and ryan figure the final presentation of our english translation of john peter s artificial versifying in the form of versifying tables from which english hexameter verse may be generated to produce a line of english verse carry out the procedure that is explained in figure with an additional instruction if a white square is traversed insert a space into the current item berg koelling and ryan was necessary because some of our items span multiple words as another visual difference in our tables the black squares that terminate items tend to appear earlier in the table this is due to our word banks being less uniform in terms of the lengths of their items until producing our tables we hadn t considered that peter may have been concerned in his translation with superficial aesthetics of the tables themselves which may have led him to devise word banks containing items of roughly the same length while we remain pleased with our final translation the variability of item length within our tables works against the superficial features dimension causing ours to diverge from peter s in terms of appearance conclusion john peter s artificial versifying was a wild success in part because of the in ventor s cleverness in developing the system by exploiting specific aspects of the latin language such as its relatively free word order and loose restrictions on modifiers an elegant combinatorial procedure was enabled one that was entirely feasible to invent and to disseminate in the material conditions of peter s day in translating the system to english we experienced firsthand the pain of cayley s local algorithmic dissonance discussed above peter deftly leverages the features of latin that lubricate his combinatorial procedure but these features are not present in english our first attempt at translation essentially a meaning oriented transliteration that maintained word order produced wonky outputs such as the bitter gift i say will show quarrels many by adding metrical constraints to our design considerations the process became even more difficult in our sec ond phase of translation ultimately we found that rearranging peter s versifying tables would be necessary to produce grammatical outputs but this too was com plicated by peter s mixing of adverbs and adjectives in table ultimately we not only swapped tables but altered the part of speech of certain items to produce a least bad system translation that we are pleased to present in this article again we would like to emphasize that translating any isolated output from the original artificial versifying is a trivial problem relative to the one we undertook berg koelling and ryan in our case each decision about how to translate one of the system s items affected tens of thousands of translations those being all the possible outputs including that item the peculiar challenge of wrangling system dynamics by making decisions about individual components is what montfort has referred to as the computational aspect that complicates e lit translation in this article we have shown that these difficulties are already present in protocomputational works that are sufficiently procedural such as john peter s artificial versifying we hope that readers will enjoy using our english translation of the system shown in figure and that our project will stimulate interest in the translation of other curious systems that intriguingly prefigured electronic literature acknowledgments we heartily thank chico zimmerman for his feedback on our translation effort in progress and for his insights on certain features of artificial versifying s original latin hexameter verse this project was made possible by a carleton college humanities center student research partnership award notes the full title of the booklet published in london by john sims is artificial versifying or the school boy s recreation a new way to make latin verses whereby any one of ordinary capacity that only knows the a b c and can count though he understands not one word of latin or what a verse means may be plainly taught and in as little a time as this is reading over how to make hundreds of hexameter verses which shall be true latin true verse and good sense while peter is not identified in the first edition a second edition by the same hand of john peter includes an author s preface in which he notes it is twice five years and upwards since the model of this fancie was first influenced into my brain a given that this preface is dated september we speculate a time frame for the system s invention roughly in the range of the london s last major outbreak of bubonic plague which spanned see moote and moote did a peculiar muse visit peter in his quarantine boredom the berg koelling and ryan date of this current publication may suggest a bias for our speculation details including peter s occupation and other publications are given in ruff which supplies the most extensive critical treatment of peter s work to date see ruff for a deeper explanation of the system ruff implies that there were two distinct third editions and binder notes a fourth edition in likely following ruff binder discovered reproductions of peter s tables in the curiosity or the gentleman and lady s library and other eighteenth century texts as for the latter we have personally identified john hill s popular arithmetick published in several editions that century e g see of the edition the latest reprint of peter s tables that we have encountered appeared in an issue of the huddersfield college magazine vol iii under the heading latin versification for the million whence this article s title of particular note is an obscure booklet by h s g that reprints peter s tables under the title carminarium latinum whereby any one of ordinary capacity though he understands not one word of latin may be taught immediately to make hexameters and pentameters true latin true verse and good sense these two sources show that peter s system was in use a full two centuries will any work of e lit have such staying power the procedure that drives john clark s eureka machine is believed to have been inspired by artificial versifying rodgers a has evocatively identified the latter as the software of the former curiously however table instead uses extra black squares in lieu of random letters while table ends with an empty white square ruff includes english glosses for each of the words in peter s six tables binder s computerization of the procedure is an interactive visualization that affords an english mode but this is a simple word for word translation that swaps the latin words for ruff s glosses producing results like sad vows for a man will cause quarrels evil to be clear neither ruff or binder claim to have produced a bona fide translation we will list here a few of the earliest instances of which we are currently aware an english translation of theo lutz s und kein engel ist schön see bernhart appeared in various newspapers in july e g palmer via the associated press wire service russian trans lations of victor yngve s computer generated sentences yngve are included in apresyan a remarkable article by hans jørgen nielsen includes his danish translations of lutz s computer poetry yngve s random sentences and also christopher strachey s computer generated love letters strachey wardrip fruin selections from a house of dust knowles et al were translated into polish by vilim crlenjak for putar english translations of boris katz s russian computer poetry appeared in zientara we have also berg koelling and ryan encountered a number of later examples montfort computerized maccormac s translation for his memory slam suite of reimple mentations of historical text generators it is with some deliberation that we have selected the word procedural one might be inclined to associate interactive or ergodic works aarseth with montfort s computational aspect but this would be misguided because it is not just interactivity that troubles translation for instance while artificial versifying is ergodic john clark s eureka is not but it is procedural enough to complicate translation likewise cursory consideration of many non ergodic text generators e g strachey lutz yngve knowles et al will reveal this notion pertinent latin options here include the revised hexameter and new pentameter verse of the second edition of artificial versifying as well as john clark s
