abstract digital selfhood and its mental spatialities of textual constructs early cyberspatial theories reflected on the qualities of computer mediated experience by introducing aspects of immateriality incorporeality symbolism abstraction as well as exploring the mental perceptual and psychological dimensions of digital experience itself electronic interactions have been described as platonically erotic transcendental allegorical even ecstatic conditions that still seem timely and compelling nowadays even since the pre pandemic era human mind appeared as an inherent ingredient of the digital phenomenon since its birth on the other side ideas such as body amnesia or fleshworld emerged denoting the rigidity of the physical body to reach the other side of the screen these days the superfluous excessive sometimes obsessive use of digital technology pervasive software as well as the internet of things have surpassed the cartesian mind body dualism and have given rise to novel hybrid approaches of our contemporary relation to technology hybridity has created space for intertextual interpretations of experience that do not divide the notion of mind and body but comment on the complex interactions of self with digital culture through numerous differentiated contexts evolving cyborg ontologies alternate bodies human nonhuman systems transformative personas neuroarchaeological readings of cultural plasticity all rendered through a daily mediated reality the study attempts to look at this ever present conundrum through an architectural point of view venturing a theoretical quest on digital spatiality digital experience has always been inseparable from the metaphoric use of spatial concepts at the same time textual space constitutes an allegorical or symbolic construction with its own architecture ambience and other characteristics space is not only relating to the strict conception of geometry physics or mathematics but also to an anthropological reading of existence a quality that is often elusive and immeasurable thus it helps define abstract psychological experiential phenomena or in other words that which is in fact indefinable in this context self takes the role of a mental dynamic while space is interpreted as a metaphoric volatile construction whose literary aesthetics emerge from digital culture the idea of digital experience is approached though a series of textual spatial concepts and projects that reflect on the space that is constructed in the interstitial area between the digitally platformed self and the mediated environment this exploration takes the form of creative writings chatbot interviews exercises of verbal configurations visual poetics interactive game poems and other of writing in both artistic and educational contexts the overall idea of the digital mind body interpretation takes the form of a series of mental spatialities that comment on our contemporary way of being in the digital world in architecture to read means to uniquely understand and thoroughly grasp the phenomena of the surrounding environment in this case space is translated in an altered vocabulary that helps us understand what it means to read the contemporary self in a platformed culture introduction i am the space where i am noël arnaud l état d ébauche contemporary digital platforms are not a novel phenomenon technological integration in many aspects of life has already been present since the onset of computers gaming or the use of web innovative digital systems smart devices and applications fast developing social media and the internet of things have already formed a fertile arnaud noël l état d ébauche le messager boîteaux paris as quoted in bachelard gaston the poetics of space orion press p ground for the platformization of everyday life the ongoing pandemic though has raised this phenomenon to an excessive degree we do not talk nowadays about the platformization of services or activities but rather about the platformization of experiences and culture additionally all connotations of the platform concept have given rise to relative discussions around notions of staging proposing programming planning or showcasing to set a platform for an experience to happen presupposes the adoption of a common language a commonly shared acting consensus though which users may be expressed during their online presence or consume digital content in a specifically designed manner an important question arises at these critical times of the pandemic phenomenon if digital platformization of multiple aspects of life is more relevant than ever nowadays then how are we to understand the ways in which ourselves are experienced through this constantly mediated condition and how can this form the onset for rethinking the already established digital norms or our potential future online presence s which lie s ahead spatial delineation as an architect spatial education has played an important role in the delineation of my selfhood through spatial mechanisms self and body are interlinked through multiple spatial correlations of definitions metaphoric expressions or even personal practices that make this notional diptych a fluctuating ontological model digital connection projection manifestation all demonstrate a shifting state of its parts space is revaluated redefined and reprogrammed domestic space is broadcasted and working spaces are interiorized bringing up modes of hybrid spatial constructs aspects of life are moving online privacy and intimacy are questioned human interaction is adapting to new formats of communication and action encounters with technology since their onset has made explicit use of spatial concepts to describe novel partially unknown experiences early interpretations of cyberspace reflected on the ideas of mediation through ideas of immateriality incorporeality abstraction of space the mental dimension is present in almost all former cyberspatial definitions the consesual hallucination by william gibson or the place where a telephone conversation appears to occur by bruce sterling are only a few of the old and well known metaphors and definitions electronic interactions have been described as platonically erotic transcendental allegorical even ecstatic conditions that still seem timely and compelling nowadays even since the pre pandemic era on the other hand contemporary approaches surpass the dualistic view and give rise to hybrid readings of the mind body relation in digital environments john perry barlow s world which is not where bodies live is now moving towards new ways of understanding space in the digital world performance artist stelarc has already commented though his work on the developing necessities of our obsolete bodies chris hables gray when talking about human machine cyborgian interaction characteristically mentioned the idea of a pseudo biosystem an organism or entity that seeks ways of digital corporealization though living and acting in a novel space these issues of computer mediated state of being are reinterpreted in this context posing questions about spatial concepts that arise during online individual experience foucault talking about the technologies of the self introduced a series of practices that to the self and its performativity in this venture

additionally these reflections are supplemented by a series of relative creative experiments in an educational context in some cases a rough outline of undergraduate or postgraduate course activities in the context of digital design media digital culture art and architecture are presented a brief overview is provided introducing quotes of works or ideas that have proven fruitful in the classroom and which can stimulate a broader discussion neil spiller characteristically mentioned a kind of laboratory that encompasses the real city the unreal city and the visceral and mental spaces of the body and the blurred spaces in between similarly in the following the idea of the spatial quality is investigated not as a strictly geometric form but rather as an atmosphere encompassing digital environments that can help us define the fluctuating either personal or collective notion of space in the contemporary platformed worlds spaces the obsessive space in in the undergraduate course

experimental dialogues were stimulated with the use of ai chatbots this idea was developed further in the context of the aforementioned course during which students were asked to take an interview of an artificial intelligence entity of their choice and generally interact perhaps train it and produce free and heretical dialogues students were free to guide the dialogue to reorder reactions to repeat questions in a context of creative writing in which half of the text manifests randomness and is placing agency of response somewhere else the process rather focuses on the creative cut up methods than on the precise recording of the process the process of writing within a dialogic state sets up a human nonhuman system through which knowledge is not only born but also performed the content of the dialogue leaves space for open translation and open ended concepts to develop manifesting the partially subjective quality of the whole interaction process neil spiller talking about
