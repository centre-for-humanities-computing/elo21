the paradox of electronic literature in the classroom the challenges for new literacy practices within the platformized school michael schlauch free university of bolzano michael schlauch education unibz it abstract reviewing the history of computing the educational potential of new ways of knowledge representa tion and new literary affordances have sparked many inﬂuential ideas and reform efforts spanning from frantic systems nelson to constructionist discovery learning papert to the reconﬁguration of literary education landow ch yet the current usages of electronic literature in education arguably fall behind those early anticipations therefore this paper explores the wider educational and social entanglements that withhold electronic literature from entering classrooms in the context of current technology transformations considering the recent pandemic related global upsurge of the digitalization of educational systems the mere lack of supply of digital devices and equipment will cease to be the main obstacle for the adoption of electronic literature in k classrooms nonetheless the question shifts to what imaginaries and discourses shape and limit the use of new digital literary affordances reviewing current trends three issues are identiﬁed these concern ﬁxations of technological disruption literacy learning objectives and the marginalization of teaching the focus on technological disruption and solutionism refers to a tendency for innovators to overly emphasize particular technological aspects and to become ﬁxated on their disruptive beneﬁts while disregarding the need for cultural and artistic conventions and communities of education practices to grow within the digital medium secondly the problematization of learning objectives relates to a prioritization of basic skills and st century workforce preparation while neglecting the need to address new critical literacy practices rather than responding with a restricted preservationist stance limited to paper based literacy educators and authors may ﬁnd ways of combining material affordances and electronic literature to introduce wider literacy conceptions in educational practice in a similar vein the marginalization of teaching is concerned with how technology is being used to quantify classify and control teaching practices within new regimes of digital governance in other words teachers are being increasingly framed as technicians and behavioral managers in place of enhancing their role as cyberbards murray given that some of the issues raised correspond to known problems in the ﬁeld of electronic literature they also provide opportunities for further transdisciplinary research into the production and adaptation of electronic literature for educational purposes introduction e lit as educational media as has been remarked in a recent un report a substantial part of digital educational media pro posed by publishers are continuations of paper textbooks at the same time a plausible deﬁnition does not seem to exist and digital textbooks are often just considered as electronic versions of tra ditional print textbooks mahatma gandhi institute of education for peace and sustainable devel opment unesco mgiep p while the speciﬁc reasons for the limited use of interactive features and affordances of the digital medium in k education are not sufﬁciently investigated re search on electronic literature is able to help clarify the underlying problems by conceptualizing the distinctions between traditional educational media and the new type of literary works made possible by computational media hayles p refers to electronic literature as digital born i e a ﬁrst generation digital object created on a computer in a more extensive deﬁnition electronic literature is described as a work with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the ca pabilities and contexts provided by the stand alone or networked computer hayles p hayles p acknowledges that this deﬁnition is still entangled with expectations of print conventions and print literary modes but electronic literature remains distinct in that it is performed by properly executed code a key notion expressed by this is that a work of electronic literature is always dependent on sociotechnical systems commonly labeled platforms that are necessary to afford those performances this is especially the case with third generation works of electronic literature that circulate within well established platforms and social networks flores while it has been noted that print literature is also contingent on particular inventions social conventions and literacy borsuk the platform aspect of electronic literature introduces new issues of de sign prescribed usage compatibility economic feasibility and equity that inﬂuence how electronic artifacts are developed made and used for educational purposes early ideas about educational uses of digital artifacts span from feeled effect systems fantics consisting of stretchtexts hypertexts hypergrams and other hypermedia nelson to visions of constructionist discovery learning papert and to the reconﬁguration of literary education landow ch yet if we understand genre as something driven by cultural and tech nological contexts rettberg up until now no distinct genre has developed within or out of the educational realm what is more reading researchers such as mangen van der weel p take the marginal role of hypertext novels as an indicator for a failed paradigm which allegedly ignores cognitive information processing and the evolutionary need for a hierarchical re lationship between author and a receptive passive reader while it is not necessary to agree with this statement this type of controversy however raises the question of whether the success of a form of electronic literature is determined by cognitive aspects alone arguably another important issue is connected to electronic literature being constrained by underlying sociotechnical contin gencies and platforms which leads us to the main question this article addresses thus from a platform perspective what are possible obstacles to the entrance of electronic literature into the mix of educational media used in k education platforms and platformization during the covid related switches to emergency remote teaching on a global scale recent de bates have concentrated on the platforms offered by the major ed tech players in the context of this conference however the notion of platform also addresses the technical foundations for forms and communities of electronic literature to emerge this indicates a need to deﬁne of the platform concept as it is interpreted by speciﬁc research strands that are different from everyday language within platform studies bogost and montfort understand platform as a computational plat form on which digital media work is based they echo marc andreessen in deﬁning a platform as a a system that can be reprogrammed and therefore customized by outside develop ers users and in that way adapted to countless needs and niches that the platform s original developers could not have possibly contemplated much less had time to ac commodate on the other side those who study the current technological transformations of the educational sector from a critical and sociological perspective also have been ﬁnding ways to account for the increasing role of code and information processing in an editorial dedicated to these issues de cuypere et al reintroduce the deﬁnition of platforms proposed by van dijck et al an online platform is a programmable digital architecture designed to organize interac tions between users not just end users but also corporate entities and public bodies it is geared toward the systematic collection algorithmic processing circulation and monetization of user data both deﬁnitions do not necessarily contradict each other rather they emphasize different as pects of what platforms are while the ﬁrst deﬁnition highlights the adaptability of platforms to count less needs and niches that are unanticipated by the developers the second deﬁnition acknowledges that many of those unanticipated uses are nevertheless embedded in larger socioeconomic frames and power dynamics baring this in mind a major concern with the trend of platformization sr nicek is how the educational sector as a whole has increasingly become programmable through technological infrastructure with implications on a pedagogical and social level that are oth erwise neglected as such educational platforms act as as connective artifacts constitutive of as well as constituted by active socio technical assemblages that are in the process of signiﬁcantly transforming the educational sector decuypere et al p with this perspective it still not clear whether current iterations of digital educational platforms actually promote or continue to marginalize literary engagement with digital born artifacts one of the concerns is that platforms often reproduce the kinds of classroom conﬁgurations and pedago gies that have been inscribed into traditional education for the past century as perrotta et al observe with reference to google classroom the tried and tested mechanisms and structures of formal schooling classrooms course work student submissions and the asymmetrical relationship between teachers and students are abstracted into a predeﬁned template for participation thus with a differentiated look at education as a platform platform is intended not as a monolithic struc ture but as ecologies of practices where different forces values and movements come together decuypere et al p this enables us to examine resulting paradoxes and ambiguities for example efforts to disrupt education may also prevent practices and literacy conceptions from changing in speciﬁc it is useful to look at these issues from the perspective of school reform literacy conceptions and the role of teaching disruptive ﬁxations it is easy to write off early ideas about electronic educational media and literature as examples of utopianism that prospected the possibility of social change simply by redeﬁning the relationship between the author and the reader yet there is a distinction between the kind of technological solutionism that has been associated with various edtech products teräs et al and techno logical idealism connected to ideas about constructivist learning in fact much of original thinking about interactive digital narrative stems from an urge to go beyond the conception of computers as a workhorse for drill and practice teaching murray p ethnographic studies such as sims provide a more nuanced insight into the drawbacks of visionary ideas as they are applied to real world contexts he argues that processes of school reform often traverse cycles of disruptive ﬁxations such cycles start with a phase of problema tization and rendering technical when experts and allies imagine and represent ﬁgured worlds that are particularly amenable to and controllable with envisioned remedies sims p these processes of problematization and rendering technical however also produce ﬁxations that exclude many factors that introduce unanticipated problems in practice in other words unantic ipated forces overﬂow the project and destabilize reformers carefully designed activities sims p overﬂowing if identiﬁed and dealt with carefully can provide a valuable occasion to question underlying assumptions and stereotypes but as sims p points out it is then far more common to quickly search for conventional resources that would stabilize the project against the unanticipated turbulence of students unsanctioned behavior ames identiﬁes as typical computer centric assumptions in constructionism the tendency to emphasize learning as an individualistic process and the belief that computers and technical devices will naturally captivate children resulting in the claim of pure discovery learning which is rarely achieved in practice further research questions may consider how these dilemmas can be used to question the as sumptions that are made as new platforms for electronic literature are developed a crucial issue at the intersection of platform studies and education for example concerns how prospective cre ators and contributors are to be involved as participants in ways that are more open equitable and inclusive without producing further idealizations or ﬁxations literacy limitations part of the neglect of educational forms of electronic literature is related to the type of literacy schools are expected to promote among children if the notion of literacy as a main educational objective has remained static over the past decades there would be no need for educational media other than print based works that precede electronic literature from a new literacies and multi literacies perspective this basic literacy idea understood as simply as reading and writing was appropriate for a society that expected its workers to be passively disciplined in the context of past industrial economies cope kalantzis p the activity of reading however is subject to change within contemporary media environments young people are content with being no less than actors rather than audiences players rather than spectators agents rather than voyeurs and users rather than readers of narrative cope kalantzis p instead of reading it is possible to refer to activities such as to interact with or to play through a digital literary artifact nevertheless those terms may be used in a ways that overlook the literacy portion needed to en gage in those kinds of meaning making implying an inherent ability of the digital native to interact and play naturally with any kind of media educational forms of electronic literature may thus be recognized as valuable resources for the promotion of a broadened notion of literacy in this case literacy teaching rather than focusing on skills and competence would aim at creating a kind of person an active designer of meaning with a sensibility open to differences change and innova tion cope kalantzis in speciﬁc burnett and merchant propose to restate the principles of literacy education as a consequence of these contemporary educational challenges accompanied by future electronic literary forms literacy education should for example promote collaboration around and through texts and artifacts acknowledge the role of multimodality the af fective embodied and material dimensions of meaning making as well as the changing nature of meaning making burnett merchant pp there is a tendency for processes of platformization to prescribe speciﬁc version of literacy as universal therefore it is crucial to seek ways for platform cultures to evolve from collective practices of meaning making rather than predetermining them neglecting teaching biesta admonishes that there is a ﬂattening of educational discourse which neglects crucial educational questions about content purpose and relationships he refers to this trend as learni ﬁcation in other words teaching is often reduced to matters of control which substantiates a simplistic opposition between teacher centered and student centered pedagogy as critics note old and new edtech promises are often accompanied by the portrayal of personalized individualized learning solutions as student centric and transformative facer selwyn yet issues of data collection control and surveillance are often the other side of the medal jarke breiter even before the entrance of computers in schools there has already been an extensive debate on educational media such as standardized textbooks and their potential role in deskilling teachers while also imposing cultural imaginaries apple a similar tendency can be found by exam ining original technology conceptions for example the teaching in teaching machines as they have been conceived by skinner p consisted in the arrangement of contingencies of reinforcement under which students learn according to watters similar assumptions about teaching have persisted throughout the history of educational technology from this perspective learniﬁcation signiﬁes the mechanization of teaching through technological means without neces sarily augmenting the agency of students and learners a departure from learniﬁcation on the other side would aim at conferring new agency to students and teachers with regard to electronic liter ature there are different ways in which teaching can be ampliﬁed rather than limiting or deskilling teachers while in the past good teachers have been described as storytellers that are competent in conﬁguring ﬂexible assemblages of learning the ﬁeld of electronic literature may support teachers with notions such as procedural authority murray p that transcend the binarism be tween learner centric freedom and teacher centric control as a result platforms in conjunction with efforts in teacher education should support teachers in partially becoming cyberbards themselves murray ch conclusions while it is impractical to predict forms of electronic literature that may thrive within contexts of formal education at this point this contribution outlines some issues that are relevant when assessing cur rent platform cultures thinking of educational platforms as connected socio technical assemblages helps clarify some of the obstacles to the entrance of electronic literature in k education those obstacles concern the unreﬂected recourse to disruptive ﬁxations limiting literacy conceptions and teachers and students whose agency is undermined in processes of learniﬁcation platforms can emerge from but also contribute in stabilizing these circumstances while current educational platforms are intertwined with data based commercial interests it is however possible to conceive future educational assemblages as platforms that provide spaces for electronic literature depending on different sets of assumptions that are to be made
