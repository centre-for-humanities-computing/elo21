 oneirografia the writing of dreams author andréa catrópa abstract oneirografia is an interactive digital work that proposes a reflection on the role of dreams in our lives created from research initiated in during the covid pandemic the work began with internet searchers on a particular dream subsequently this creative process became an investigation into the atavistic relationships that the human species maintains with dreams and observed the different meanings that this state of mind has acquired throughout our history oneirografia is inspired by dream experiences and allows the user to navigate in a d environment into this environment is possible to receive the message of the oracle which is a combinatorial poem in addition the user can make up his e dreams composed of the choices made during navigation e dreams mix images filters and text it is possible from there to save the formed images or share them keywords digital literature e lit dreamlike narrative oneirografia dreams oneirografia is a work of digital literature whose creation process began almost simultaneously with the arrival of restrictive measures to circulation and socialization due to the pandemic of covid in the city of são paulo brazil the work was motivated by a dream and this process started in march unfolded in bibliographic and iconography research that same year the partial results of this research were presented at some national and international academic congresses and i ve published an article on this subject in the first phase of the project the research focused on a search for correspondence between the dream that motivated them and their possible connections to the waking world since the night experience had as a scenario a certain geographical locality the city of prague and this was unknown to the dreamer the first resource used for this verification was the internet search algorithms thus correlates were sought between the dreamed city and its physical configuration due to the impossibility of traveling to do on the spot research either by restrictions caused by the spread of coronavirus or by high costs and travel distance between south and central europe the internet has proved to be a viable resource for research the initial verification was based on a translation of the dreamlike images into the natural language which in turn was used to trigger the search mechanisms these mechanisms translate into code the typed letters submitting to the performance optimization processes of the search algorithms the semantic structures filtered from the dream by consciousness which attempts to organize rationally the dreamlike deviations that flee from the logic of the facts observed in daylight the path described was followed by the creation of a dream map which was not intended for aesthetic fruition but only for the dream record for future reflections and consultations as its details were erased from memory over time in some ways too the map intertwines an imponderable and intimate experience to how seekers define the city of prague through its monuments its buildings and its historical characters for the virtual tourist the dream images were thus transformed into a verbal simplification used as an input to generate outputs such as museum sites wikipedia entries official and amateur photographs of monuments and the most visited places in prague pages with tourist information recommendations of bars shops markets cafes restaurants and hotels in the city with their respective user reviews maps and virtual representations of the environments via google street view these data gathered both the contributions of residents as well as information shared by visitors all filtered by the algorithms and customized according to the researcher s profile information since this calibration by user profile is a common practice of internet searchers in this way it can be said that the dream map points to an imaginary city created by the conjunction of collective inputs algorithmic tracking and the personal element of reworking the dream experience the elaboration of the dream map allowed the research from then on to revolve around the terms that signaled a consensus on the world of dreams and the verification by algorithmic mediation of facts and particularities virtually accessible concerning the city of prague however even though the result of this research method has been fruitful and has raised material for theoretical reflection and artistic creation since the beginning of we have opted for a path different from what has been followed so far the perception that the pandemic did not cool down and kept a large part of the world population in a state of exception due to the growing health economic and social problems contributed to the questioning of the validity of creating a work aimed at a particular experience somehow the coronavirus its transmissibility and its lethality put into question some values that define the daily lives of most citizens living in western metropolises such as narcissism and exacerbated individualism the possibility of falling ill of losing one s own life or loved ones due to a virus that travels through the air from one body to another emphasizes human vulnerability reminding us of the animal contingency of depending on a body whose functioning lasts for a finite time we are virtual beings if we wish only to the extent that our bodies live but before that we are mortal and this fact cannot be controlled only with willpower regular exercise and healthy eating we are aware of social inequalities and their effects even more perverse in this pandemic even so even though they are less susceptible to complications when they become infected there are also young people there are athletes there are rich people who succumb to the coronavirus if when programming smart computers we dreamed of living in a world purified of human imperfection we now see most sadly and harshly how different we are from machines this emphasizes our links as a species and made the creative process based on a particular experience less significant than working with the atavistic relationships that we maintain with dreaming scientific studies and different reports since the beginning of the covid pandemic have been focusing on a very noticed phenomenon the increase in the report of abnormal dreams in this long period in which a large part of the world population has experienced unprecedented conditions in their lives students from the university of toronto for example developed research in which the result was the report of more vivid dreams between its participants they ve also related an increase in the occurrence of nightmares and night episodes that involved amplification of anxiety and also a portion of dream narratives that contained references to the particularities experienced by many of us in a pandemic daily life the dream which was valued by western peoples in antiquity as a way of knowing future events has now come to be understood increasingly as the result of individual perceptions and concerns freud s psychoanalytic theory of dreaming states that the censorship of the conscious operates even when we re asleep and the unusual dream language aims to protect us from direct contact with information that transmitted objectively we might not be able to bear ribeiro proposes a link between the psychoanalytic bias and the scientific approach to dream mechanisms seeking to establish their atavistic links with the human species in his book ribeiro defines the dream as a probabilistic oracle in which simulations of past events combine with future expectations in associative narratives which allow the dreamer to carry out simulations that in some way prepare him for life if we take into consideration the summary made above about some perceptions about the dream and the growing attention that this everyday phenomenon received from academic researchers during the covid pandemic we can ask ourselves about the importance of this activity in our life in the past few months and how cities and their frenetic pace have influenced our ability to use this ancient tool for our self knowledge and to reflect on our actions in the world the imaginative capability of the dreaming sleeper underwent a relentless erosion and the vitiated identity of a visionary was left over for a tolerated minority of poets artists and mad people modernization could not proceed in a world populated with large numbers of individuals who believed in the value or potency of their own internal visions or voices some difficulties to resonate with our experiences during sleep come from the lack of habit of saving time when we wake up to remember our dreams and share them with other people such difficulty also points to our individualism and the pursuit of productivity and rationality which distances us from this activity whose ancestral importance has left several marks in human culture these reflections determined the new paths of our artistic creation process that resulted in oneirografia this work aims to remember and share dreams in a digital environment for this it is structured as follows after choosing one of the languages in which the project is available portuguese spanish and english the user receives a welcome message in the chosen language a form automatically appears on the screen in which the user will write something about the dream they want to remember or create using any language they prefer as the three options listed above restrict only the languages in which the navigation instructions are exposed at this stage the work is expected to function as a kind of dream diary in which the user can record his words in up to characters divided into three fields of characters each to proceed to the next step you need to write something at least one letter in all fields the idea is to encourage the user to spend time reflecting and seeking to recover their dream experiences so it is not possible to advance in the work without completing this step then it is possible to choose between the dream or the nightmare door this action will bring different sound and chromatic environments for the crossing of a corridor that represents the separation between the waking life for the dream universe where the actions will be more sensory and intuitive this universe is constituted by an immersive d environment where navigation follows the structure of the games however the first person character does not follow rules to achieve explicit goals the intention is that the exploration of this field occurs in a contemplative way even though it allows access to two key elements of the work the message of the oracle and the word search which finally leads the user to access his e dream the oracle s message is a combinatory poem composed of six variables each with ten different options which makes repetition of a composition unlikely to happen since the chance of recurrence is very reduced in addition in the code there is a ban on the repetition of a poem exactly as it was conveyed in its last configuration which further reduces the likelihood of a user reading the same poem the title of the composition always repeats the structure variable sends a message and in the place of this first variable we have ten options oracle artemidorus freud maya xoaltentli hypnos nyx morpheus icelos phantasos jurupari and kerepiyua these words represent characters or deities related to the world of dreams in different cultures the same permutational logic remains in the rest of the poem s formulation which in addition to the title is composed of another three lines and five more variables versions of the poem in one of the three languages chosen for navigation can appear on the screen of a tv that is in the d environment if the user clicks the call button in this case a tts text to speech mechanism is activated and the poem also receives an audio version with the synthetic voice calibrated so that it does not have a regular humanly sound but is affected by the dreamlike atmosphere of the surroundings to leave the environment it is necessary to follow the trail of the bright spheres that are heading to a certain point the big eye which moves to always observe the movements of the user by clicking on this image the user is transported to a d sphere on which is the word search in the transition between the environments the instructions appear capture three words that relate to your dream or nightmare in this stage there is a determined quantity of concrete and abstract nouns that must be chosen due to their close relationship with the e dream that the user wants to represent or create the arrangement of terms is rearranged randomly each time there is an entry into the sphere this instability in the positioning of words and their limited quantity given the infinite possibilities of the dream takes the user to a new contemplative moment in the construction of the dream language condensation and displacement mechanisms operate which distort the messages of the unconscious so that they become bearable for the dreamer in word searches it is necessary to choose between just a few terms perhaps not matching entirely the dream narrative to give visible shape to a new universe and make it an e dream that can be saved or shared after selecting three words the create button appears for the user from there he just needs to wait for the next screen to load to receive the result of his plunge into the world of dreams the figure that appears to the user is formed by an image bank in which the words chosen in the previous step and calibrated to represent dreams or nightmares are combined in layers in addition one of the three fields filled in the initial form appears on the image composition some filters and distortions are used randomly to modify the composition of the images and the fonts used in the text will vary between possible versions thus the e dream is formed for the user by merging the images he chose through the selection made in the word search and the phrases he wrote earlier from there it is at the user s discretion to recreate an e dream randomly using the elements of that same navigation or going back to the beginning of the process to make other options for reports and word choices it is also possible to disable the display of the text on the formed image annd download the created e dreams either to just keep these images with you or to share them digitally oneirografia will https www andreacatropa com oneirografia available be for online access on the page acknowledgments i am grateful for the
