maría mencía digital methodologies for analysing and disseminating community research a reflection on practice by the artist researcher keywords methodology co creation collaboration multimodality community research community building digital platforms tools creative practices storytelling healing societal issues covid the global covid pandemic has made me further address the value that artistic practice can have on our mental and psychological health and its significance in community healing according to gloster at et al the main impact of the virus was uncertainty and of the lockdowns were stress depression affect and wellbeing p covid has affected our mental health raising feelings of uncertainty isolation hopelessness fear and anxiety it has challenged us to change our lifestyles and rebalance our commitments to work family education and recreation this global disaster has also hit people from disadvantaged backgrounds much harder particularly those in challenging financial situations suffering from pre existing health conditions or living with violent and abusive partners it has shown us just how imbalanced our societies are in terms of race and gender for example online platforms have taken a major role serving to make this situation more bearable we are learning to do what we did before at a distance and in some cases even in isolation as an artist and researcher in creative practices i have for a while now used such online platforms to create spaces to share personal stories i have been able to connect narratives to bring up issues of power territory displacement personal and historical memory gender and violence the covid pandemic has forced us to live work socialise at a distance using such digital platforms and it has highlighted the importance of finding ways to engage global communities to share their healing stories even if it is done in isolation and at a distance through electronic literature and art consequently in this paper i would like to explore the use of methodologies and digital tools which can help to conduct and disseminate interdisciplinary research projects alongside artists and communities i have experience of working in community groups in galleries museums and schools and my research and practice draws from these however the two projects discussed in this paper invisible voices and share to heal workshop are more focused on societal issues which occurred due to specific social or political circumstances of a period in time they address questions in connection to community histories the value that creative storytelling and artistic approaches can have in sharing personal stories and the value of working directly with participants the paper also highlights the impact these projects can have not only to these specific communities but also to society in general project one invisible voices women victims of the colombian conflict the first case study in this context is titled invisible voices women victims of the colombian conflict funded by the arts and humanities research council ahrc of england and addresses the issue of the representation of the conflict and victims in colombia s year long conflict we have been aware of the use of the internet as a medium and as a platform for communication and dissemination for a long time now in the early s many artists took advantages of this medium to produce work outside the confinements of the gallery and even geographical and national barriers with works of netart mark tribe and reena jana in their condensed and comprehensive book new media art look at art practices in the age of digital communication and distribution they present examples representatives of how artists have always engaged with emerging media technologies the internet one of them as it made a global movement of art to explore cultural social and aesthetics possibilities this global characteristic is now a leading aspect in the way we experience the everyday in connection to the use of online platforms for more creative practices tribe and jana p highlight how the internet has meant different things for different people whether a way to get rich a place for political grassroots a place for publishing for distributing information and for advertising as they mention as early as new terms started to appear such as web the net cyberspace and dot com which now are so familiar it was around this time that the first commercial web browsers enabled everyone to become a digital artist and made the world wide web a source of inspiration and dissemination up till now artists have used the internet as a medium and a way to create and distribute digital art literature however separation between the medium and the artist still existed the physical and the virtual spaces were still apparent and although virtual reality has brought them closer it is arguably only through the current global pandemic that media technologies have become engrained in our lives accentuating our dependence on online communication the way we experience our everyday life communicate interact and understand the social the cultural the self through the digital medium has changed in this age of pandemic separation and isolation geographical boundaries have become closer through online platforms poignant issues of neglect from many governments in tackling covid make it even more imperative to think of new ways to build applications where users can share personal stories concerns mental health problems challenges or social issues through narrative methods and media art practices we need to connect the it was undertaken in conjunction with an interdisciplinary team of experts working in different fields of research

and place from which to draw material to create artwork community of electronic literature art with such communities in our new local globalised spaces with the primary aim of healing community research this interest in building communities and sharing stories had already started to emerge from my art and came into realisation through my artistic practice based research project the winnipeg the poem that crossed the atlantic where through digital humanities research and the use of digital methodologies international communities came together to heal issues of cultural identity heritage memory homeland migration exile refugees disaggregation and displacement were addressed and more recently through the project invisible voices created alongside a community of women who have suffered violence and trauma invisible voices women victims of the colombian conflict is a practice based research project part of the bigger research investigation memory victims and representation of the colombian conflict above all it focuses on exploring and incentivising new means of awareness with regards to the self representation of women victims of the colombian conflict through different creative practices we invited members of the ruta pacífica de las mujeres with women from across colombia and from the corporation of zoscua in boyacá to take part in a week of co creation workshops in bogota to discuss through storytelling and creative practices their experience as victims of the colombian armed conflict as co investigator my role was leading the workshops with the aim to collect materials to create a documentary website and create an online digital artwork the aim of the workshops was to give voice to the women victims who were participating and construct a collective memory a memory where they felt represented it involved collecting materials for the website an interactive digital artwork and producing suggestions for alternative forms of representation of victimhood which are victim centric primarily through storytelling and the digital art the digital art explored the potential of digital technologies through multimodality non linear representations non classic narratives and in a way the women could understand and interact with their different literacies i posed a series of research enquires starting with for more information see https www

action which works for the negotiated processing of the armed conflict in colombia and to make visible the impact of the war on the lives and bodies of women it is pacifist antimilitarist and builder

corporation of zoscua is based in the city of tunja in boyacá colombia it contributes to the construction of democracy based on social justice and works for the strengthening and consolidation of democratic forms of civic and social participation with the goal to improve the living conditions of their communities see http zoscua blogspot com accessed how digital technologies could help to make visible the voices of the women victims i explored the opportunities co creative practices could provide as methodology for collaboration between artist and community with the aim of making the participants agents of change as well as a co creation as a method for healing through sharing i explored how hybrid artistic practices including physical analogue and digital could facilitate new forms of audio visual representations our documentary website resulted in a detailed research project which allowed its participants to voice their experience through a clear set of goals and research questions to showreel the creative process of the workshops methods participation and media used and to thereby create a work of digital art which also allowed for the addition of comments in the mobile application physical face to face workshops to find more tailored methods designed in response to this specific context i liaised with the colombian local impact coordinator who had already worked with some of the women and were happy to contribute to this mixed media and multimodal production she interviewed them before i designed the workshops and this helped me to understand how i could interact with them largely through asking the right questions in a manner they would find them relevant to their experiences it was important that these documents were written for the lay person to understand the work s aim and scope as well as their significance as agents of change the participants needed to be aware that the sessions would be recorded and that these recordings will constitute a significant part of the final artwork they were all of course anonymised integral to the nature of this work was to provide a transparent approach to create a safe environment and to build trust thus the next step was to involve the research group in discussions to provide women with a programme of activities for them to choose from this was important due to the mixed abilities and literacies among the group this method of co creation was a significant part of the process because it allowed the women to become more investing in the study instead of being passive providers of information to be used by an artist they took an active role in deciding how they wanted their stories to be told within this space of cocreation we worked with life stories and story based communication as hardy sumner and lambert have significantly used in their storytelling practice as well as explored creative approaches and processes individual and in group using multimodal communication through visual audio writing and performance practices the participants were encouraged to bring materials and through user generated processes we gathered photographic material also the artworks women created in the workshops in the form of audio visual and written materials became part of both the artwork and the website why storytelling in this paper i have highlighted the value of personal stories for learning and awareness joe lambert has been working extensively with the practice of digital storytelling he founded the centre for digital storytelling now storycentre in and he is the author of seven stages story and the human experience the storycentre s document on storytelling program impacts describes how over the last years health education academia and community have welcomed storytelling and participatory media production methods to share life experience narratives through the production of filmmaking narratives they are interested in the first person voice the process participation and the multimedia production storycentre has a range of methods which they identify under the umbrella of storywork they write we work closely with workshop participants to ensure that the social and political determinants of individual experience are brought out in their stories storycentre storytelling program impacts p from the studies they have carried out they believe that using storytelling to express sensitive topics that might have stigmas such as discrimination victimisation or mental health issues help to contextualise the issue or problem and this is where change happens i can recognise this identification process in invisible voices where for instance the women felt unheard and by being able to identify their lack of representation in the colombian conflict and find ways to make their voice heard it made a difference to them and gave them more strength to fight for their beliefs and determination to change society storycentre s principles highlight the following sharing stories can lead to positive change personal narratives can touch viewers deeply moving them to reflect on their own experiences modify their behaviour treat others with greater compassion speak out about injustice and become involved in civic and political life whether online via social media in local communities or at the institutional policy level the sharing of stories has the power to make a real difference storycentre core principles p women taking part in invisible voices were highly active about their rights and political life and spoke candidly as well as with passion anger and pain about the injustice they and other women had suffered during the colombian armed conflict in their feedback they identified as one of their goals to make a real difference this is why they like to take part in workshops to help other women get strength and continue their fight for those they love and for a change in society in general later in the paper i have added some of their feedback comments received once the project was published and exhibited online other areas where storytelling is being used very successfully is in healthcare pip hardy and tony sumner in their book cultivating compassion how digital storytelling is transforming healthcare explore how storytelling as a reflective process can cause a change in health and mental issues in their preface they write powerful personal stories promote reflection prompt discussion and debate highlight opportunities for learning and improvement encourage the cultivation of empathy and compassion and remind all those engaged in the business of healthcare of our shared humanity hardy sumner p xviii again the above is resonant with invisible voices we started the co creation workshops with an activity where women were invited to bring an object and express their experiences of the colombian conflict through this object this exercise provoked extremely personal testimonies loaded with overwhelming emotion and felt with empathy and group discussions from which to learn and reflect women found sharing these first person stories and collaborative creative projects helped them to heal increased their self esteem made them feel more empowered and that they were taking part in colombia s historical memory digital spaces website digital art app the digital outcomes of this project as above mentioned consist of a documentary website digital artwork and a mobile application used to collect stories the website follows the research process through slide shows with photographs of the workshops installations audio stories generated from the objects the participants were invited to bring as a starting point this created powerful stories which can be heard in spanish with and english translation in a pdf with titles such as proud of being black when i was years old heal and save signification of the bandana my little children deep pain will carry on flighting accept i was a victim displacement and lost son as well as videos documenting the process of the workshops with titles including let me refresh your memory threading memories listen to us their place within memory our bodies were left in threads and a museum for me the interactive digital art consists of three parts their place within memory reflecting the memory space personal and collective memory represented by the activity in the writing on the wall do you hear us this represents the political activist space with photographs of events organized by the women voices constructing memory has a variety of narrations gathered from the workshop with themes including participation in political activism and culture issues of power territory displacement violence and gender representation such as a museum for me body politics with our body was left in shreds historical and personal memory i refresh your memory writing on the wall and threading memories in addition the two engineers fellow co investigators dr claudia liliana zúñiga cañón from universidad santiago de cali colombia and dr rafael asorey cacheda from the universidad politécnica de cartagena spain together with students from the universidad santiago de cali developed a mobile application or app called mujeres voces invisibles del conflicto mvic through the use of this app women can share their stories in writing orally or through video during and after the workshops following an anonymous system as registration is by invitation and only verified users it always guarantees anonymity and all the testimonials are confidential with texts audios and videos stored in encrypted form no personal data or metadata is stored only the author and the creators of the work can access its contents it was also encrypted making the theft of useful information impossible any user of the platform can delete their testimonials and account at any time and the deletion is permanent both the app and the artwork are accessible through the menu in the documentary website impact art practices as a healing methodology these digital outputs from this project have helped to analyse and disseminate community research in a multimodal way making it accessible for a variety of readers most importantly the digital stories seem to have been of great help for this particular community documenting what this group of women did in the workshops and having the stories published and exhibited online has allowed them ownership and control over their work and they now see themselves represented in the feedback questionnaire in the question about the final online project where we asked what they thought about the final product in general and if they wanted to make any other contributions these were the answers i found it very beautiful and interesting it moved me to see my fellow participants again to listen to our voices to see the museums the map everything is wonderful but above all the emotion and joy of seeing your work of art come to life and i say my work of art because i feel it that way more than a contribution i have a request that this does not end here that you continue with this task of constructing memory in an artistic way that contributes to a symbolic and restorative reparation i would also like to be present when the people who contributed to this project get to see it a wonderful work i hope its visibility makes an impact and that all of colombia realises that the conflict is national and that no one can take for granted that something like this won t happen to them that it continues to be replicated and that it be one more tool for women victims to continue their healing the result in general for me is gratifying because i met many people that i never ever thought i would get to know being there sharing with everyone and knowing that there are other people who are looking for us to tell our stories is very comforting the best thing that could have happened to me was to join zozcua because along the way i have been able to strengthen myself and continue my struggle to discover the truth and i see many of these feelings reflected in the results of the project my suggestion would be to continue the project to learn more and give more of oneself the digital publication clearly has added to their experience as creators of the work by seeing it represented online and the co creation methodology has functioned as a great participatory exercise to empower these women and heal by sharing worth highlighting is a question we asked about their experience of the benefits of taking part in such artistic activities sound weaving drawing creating plaster models photographs and video and sharing their experiences through the production of art practices to transform feelings of pain and grief these are some of their answers yes because by activating and communicating with all the senses the healing aspect is more intense and accurate of course they are important and they help because the victims realize in these encounters that there are many families who experience similar tragedies and this helps to generate catharsis it seems to me to be a lovely project for example when we were doing the hands the weaving of the sack and the map we all got together and we were waiting to do those activities and there i managed to capture my feelings of pain and understand that i was not alone and that it was worth continuing healing a feeling of being accepted when someone s testimony is followed up with hugs and words of encouragement of course because art is transformative and in this way we can tell or relive our stories in a less painful way with a purpose and that purpose is to contribute to non repetition with these activities we construct not only individual memory but also collective memory that strengthens us and allows us to dream of a better country it was painful and at the same time good because it brings out everything one has inside finally i pose the question why should we work with such participants i believe part of the answer is in understanding what needed to be changed and to make them part of this change in this case we were able to see the colombian conflict from their unique perspective in this project the impact of the work in the participants is right at the centre and for the artist and researchers it was overwhelming and satisfying but also humbling to see that the project was able to so positively touch these peoples lives the second case study for analysis is the workshop share to heal creative digital practices community platform for healing and visualisation which is still yet to happen at the online elo platform post pandemic conference and festival in collaboration with vinicius marquet it will focus on the questions about whether the digital can transform research community work and facilitate healing through story sharing we have created an online community platform prototype to share stories which we will make use of at the conference project two share to heal workshop creative digital practices community platform for healing and visualisation the aim of this workshop is to make visible through sharing social personal or collective issues challenges which had become more apparent during the covid global pandemic of and to create meaningful conversations through the production of creative digital proposals to heal them the issues work as an inspiration for creative practice based on the global pandemic the above creative projects and marquet s experience of the workshop as a methodology for creativity and exchange of ideas and building on a common interest in a community based goal we have put together an online platform for sharing and exchanging stories we will use digital methodologies of collaboration and mapping to highlight the main concerns of the community taking part in this discussion visualising is also an aim which we might have to look at later after realising the workshop thus for this purpose we have already provided the participants with an online platform where they will be able to share a personal or collective issue challenge in connection to the pandemic the shared stories will be distributed amongst the participants through the share to heal platform the participants will have to find inspiration in the issues to find a way to heal them by coming up with a creative digital proposal all anonymised the only prerequisite is for the participants to have the story ready in advance we want them to have time to think about the story and bring something relevant to their experience of the pandemic they should be able to write their own personal story or copy paste a text from a newspaper depending on personal preference using no more than words or characters to save time this input needs to be digitally available at the beginning of the workshop during the production of the share to heal platform the questions we initially addressed were related to the design and programming needed to implement the exchanging of stories and their mapping against the digital projects suggested by the participants as with the previous project we are addressing the opportunities co creative methodologies provide for collaboration between artists and community to highlight the main concerns of the community taking part in this discussion we have a keyword section which will be visualised in an upcoming platform so the issues covered in each particular workshop can be seen at a glance creative digital proposals to heal as previously mentioned this is the second step of the workshop where the participants are allocated an inspirational story to heal through the creation of a digital media project participants can use interdisciplinary collaborative and or co creative methodologies and the proposals can suggest any modality aural visual written or any digital media genre that is animation illustration generative interactive networked narrative performative immersive vr ar locative the workshop as research methodology following rikke ørngree s model will also be studied to analyse the creative approaches and processes individual and in group experiences gained this can be an area for discussion at the conference presentation what experiences have we all gained who benefits from the stories does digital storytelling work as a healing process from invisible voices the learning experience benefited both the facilitators and the women they communicated to us that they didn t feel revictimized on the contrary they felt that sharing the pain and transform it into something beautiful for people to see was very gratifying they felt they have been heard they were not alone they were empowered with the creation of this work and authorship their feelings changed felt stronger they became the voices of those other women who have no voices in particular they liked these methodologies as it wasn t just purely about their individual stories but was also about creating something out of their experiences thus using not only aural storytelling as life stories but the fact they had to create artwork seemed to have empowered them more for the investigators this was a learning experience like no other the method was to listen to hear from these women we were there as facilitators we learnt about the colombian conflict from their experience their resilience to pain their power to carry on fighting against injustice their camaraderie and support for each other as an artist i have never felt so humble and for me this has been a project not only of great importance but with a wider social significance references gloster at lamnisos d lubenko j
