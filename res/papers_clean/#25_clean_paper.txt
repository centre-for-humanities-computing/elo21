 an internet bard at last the positive and perverse power of alt lit poet steve roggenbuck content warning this paper discusses instances of and responses to grooming emotional abuse and sexual violence introduction in a strict sense i don t believe there s any definition of poetry that applies to all poets different poets have different goals different poets have different things in their hearts that they re trying to express in different ways that they want to express them are my videos where i m running around in the woods talking about yolo and dogs and dads are these really poetry why call them poetry roggenbuck an internet bard these are the words of steve roggenbuck a twenty something self proclaimed video artist and poet who released youtube videos from to roggenbuck s video poems comprised clips of his stream of consciousness often filmed while he rolled in the grass or ran through natural scenes screaming amongst random and frankly weird remarks roggenbuck also offered words of motivation urging viewers to appreciate nature and follow their dreams many videos have been edited to include musical accompaniment green screen facilitated backgrounds and or additional graphics over seven years roggenbuck s fanbase grew larger and more devoted with roggenbuck being established as one of the alt lit alternative literature movement s most renowned contributors in october though roggenbuck s fans turned their backs to him as he confirmed allegations of sexual misconduct allegations that followed numerous others made against alt lit contributors roggenbuck makes for an interesting subject of study because he embodies various facets of digital culture visual and aural disjointedness conscious contempt for grammatical correctness a poetic license so to speak premeditated performance of personality and as he has confirmed sexual misconduct brought to light in the metoo moment this paper also centers on roggenbuck because focus on a single individual allows for deeper understanding of the particular qualities of alt lit and third generation e literature henceforth g e lit more generally that facilitate such behavior an individual example allows us to concretize otherwise abstract arguments this paper first introduces readers to roggenbuck s work observing how his poetry fits within the category of g e lit it then considers how the allegations against roggenbuck may impact interpretations of his work it aims to start a conversation about negotiating cultural value and socially unacceptable authorial behavior with new expectations and potential issues for g e lit to use roggenbuck s own words roggenbuck an internet bard i am the bard i am the poet and to be a poet while the internet exists man we got an opportunity the opportunity offered by the internet allowed roggenbuck to rise to fame it was also his demise although roggenbuck has engaged with other forms of dissemination including print and podcasting his youtube videos are the primary focus of this paper roggenbuck s videos as third generation e lit steve roggenbuck was born in michigan in he earned a degree in creative writing from central michigan university and began an mfa program at columbia college chicago but did not complete his studies davidson i recently decided to drop out of my school because it had no purpose for me roggenbuck explains in one of his videos from nobody can stop you i was just doing it people will do things that they don t need to do they don t need to spend time on it but they just do it because that s what everybody does but roggenbuck did not seem to need an mfa to succeed online alongside his poetry youtube channel featuring videos from to which at the time of writing collectively have nearly two million views roggenbuck also uploaded videos to another channel that features vlogs information about his vegan lifestyle and his plant liker podcast which ran in plant liker channel another podcast hosted by roggenbuck called read poetry and eventually die ran from to read poetry roggenbuck also cofounded boost house a poetry publisher and vegan co op house funded by more than usd of kickstarter donations raised in days at the end of boost house boost house between and he released six books of poetry most of which are still available as free e books in addition roggenbuck toured across the usa canada western europe and australia selling t shirts adorned with snippets of his poetry along the way roggenbuck is often classified as a catalyst for alt lit a movement broadly characterized by online self publication social media usage and conscious self reference to internet culture renowned alt lit authors include elizabeth ellen sheila heti and tao lin among others in a article for the new yorker kenneth goldsmith heralded roggenbuck as one of the bright stars of alt lit a year later fan wu described roggenbuck as a heavy hitter and at the same time an internet maniac a review holloway speculates that w hen alt lit s wiki has been finally whittled away his roggenbuck s will be the one name left this same review observes that roggenbuck embodies in a way virtually no other alt lit wordsmith does the new sincerity and ends by stating that kate tempest made me want to be a better poet steve roggenbuck made me want to be a better human being while excitement for alt lit has largely waned the genre is perpetuated in various corners of the web it is also implicitly manifest in meme culture notably the subset of the image macro when humorous text usually in a white blocky typeface is placed atop a related or perhaps purposely unrelated image roggenbuck s work and much of alt lit more generally sits comfortably in the category of g e lit as leo flores explains g e lit starting from around to the present uses established platforms with massive user bases such as social media networks apps mobile and touchscreen devices and web api services this third generation accounts for a massive scale of born digital work produced by and for contemporary audiences for whom digital media has become naturalized g e lit meets audiences where they are through references to popular culture and remixes of extant content at the same time alex saum pascual suggests critique over continuity noting that g e lit maintains a hyperawareness of the capitalist commodification and datafication of human experience on the web but relates to it in a sort of ironic shoulder shrug meh as it oscillates between defiance and conformism other scholars have also argued for a critical political economy of amateur digital artifacts like video poetry posted to popular platforms iribarren saum pascual observes that purposeful amateurism is read as a critique of those other polished techno imperialist aesthetics that make software invisible or that make even hardware invisible poor remixes glitchy programs patchy sites all serve as a reaction to the cleanliness lightness and invisible pervasiveness of the web in our lived experience much of the praise roggenbuck received during his popularity climax noted his ability to spark interest in poetry amongst teenage and young adult viewers through such oscillation between defiance and conformism as well as through his purposeful amateurism in an early video roggenbuck reflects upon what he considers the problems of modern poetry almost every poetry book is eighty pages long he laments am i even a poet almost every poetry book is twelve point god dang font black on white left aligned i m interested in the more flowing culture art is the making of belief systems how can you have a belief system if all you have is eighty page black on white twelve point font serifs god help me as his videos were posted roggenbuck s distinctive poetic style emerged and evolved to reflect this flowing culture one video from may twitter followers begins with motivational clips of shunryu suzuki and gary vaynerchuk transitions to roggenbuck listing ridiculous ways to be murdered and then ends with roggenbuck doing what looks to be a frenetic napoleon dynamite inspired dance by august roggenbuck has started filming outside how to live your lief within only a few months he is screaming at the camera while outdoors or in public spaces nobody can stop you by his video style appears to have informed his performance style and a video of a live poetry reading opens with roggenbuck excitedly declaring that i am a fucked up prick steve roggenbuck at lollapagazna the first video to showcase all of these features is dated december lief is beautiful although numerous preceding videos include various combinations of these features roggenbuck starts using a green screen at the end of around the same time he develops his fascination with different types of clouds don t quit teachers and researchers have observed how digital affordances are changing forms and perceptions of poetry in ways that correspond with roggenbuck s views padgett and curwood stuart moreover many continue to question the internet s effects on literary cultures de haas inwood murray tsaaior despite inconsistent conclusions it is clear that digital technologies are changing what it means to be a poet and what it means to read or as per roggenbuck s evocation of poetry s oral tradition hear and even see a poem roggenbuck directly responded to these changes through explicit observation of the contemporary literary landscape as well as deliberate experimentation with literary form and video editing software for roggenbuck poetry is not words on a page but the evocation of feelings that promote the interconnectedness of human experience roggenbuck s work is rooted in the banality of the everyday encouraging viewers to consider both the beauty and the suffering of their own lives at the same time his work embraces the strangeness of mental processes and incoherent thoughts so often pushed aside in favor of rationality roggenbuck is in these ways a prime example of a g e lit poet a mass of diverse cultural influence packaged in a performance that is both bewildering and beautiful roggenbuck s aesthetic including the misspellings in his video titles videos and youtube twitter and tumblr comments and posts distinguished him not just on the social media platforms he was using but also within the more traditional poetic tradition that he wanted to be part of in one of the few scholarly reviews of roggenbuck s work prathna lor argues that roggenbuck advocates for the reconceptualization of textual production through social media as poetic production and he attempts to infuse poetry into every aspect of digital production as a democratizing force paradoxically such attempts nonetheless perpetuate a logic of exceptionalism and the cult of celebrity roggenbuck s work thus provides an example of digital realism in which social media is used to produce a low poetics that is sincere and lifelike and yet ultimately fictive roggenbuck establishes a powerful persona of relatability however as lor acknowledges this is indeed a persona a consciously crafted character in his article about roggenbuck lor identifies a fundamental issue with the tendency towards digital realism namely that it is commonly straight white and male in lor s words digital realism mobilizes social media poetics as a force of democracy but it also frequently rests on exclusionary logics of white male heterosexism the digital realism of roggenbuck and of alt lit more broadly celebrates expressions of banality boredom and absurdity by privileged subject positions in literature in the digital age adam hammond similarly notes the complexity of the celebrity enjoyed by alt lit writers writing that i f their literary productions are deliberately lazy flat and boring their strategies of self promotion are tireless and ingenious this calculated use of popular social media makes the social dimensions of poetry visible to twenty first century readers mcgrath such use responds to the emergence of a new kind of predominately digital audience which expects access not just to an author s works but also to glimpses of that author s personal life and mind and glimpses into roggenbuck s mind we get however dark undoubtedly representing efforts to be deliberately shocking many of roggenbuck s videos make reference to the illuminati satanism murder or dead children he may also insert more sexualized clips wherein he mentions kissing sex penises his own or those of others or some combination thereof i will literally kiss this cake into your mouth he declares in one video me and you you fucking dumbass i got my dick length notarized he shouts in another the lost tapes as time progresses though roggenbuck more explicitly incorporates issues of social justice including feminism into his videos in a video from be yourslef part he recommends bell hooks the will to change men masculinity and love in another from the same year violent j in roggenbuck use interlibrary loan he includes a clip of violent j from musical duo insane clown posse commenting on fellow musician chris brown fuck chris brown every time they spin his shit they re not spinning somebody else s shit who didn t beat up a woman these examples illustrate the manifestation of our modern zeitgeist of advocacy the oscillation between defiance and conformism observed by alex saum pascual in works of g e lit they also illustrate the protean nature of the human mind roggenbuck is consistently inconsistent in a way that affirms his personal depth to his audience the apparent randomness of roggenbuck s videos make his moments of insight even more impactful amidst of rapid video cuts and frantic remarks roggenbuck inserts clips of either motivational speakers e g gary vaynerchuk and steve jobs or himself inciting critical self reflection and at times uninhibited hedonism in early videos he touts his idea of boosting encouraging people to be their best selves through acknowledgement of everyday joy and by passionately following their dreams in later videos he speaks to viewers more directly have i convinced you that when you breathe it is the most miraculous thing that has ever happened in history roggenbuck asks in one video life is right now everybody dies he declares in another make something make something beautiful before you are dead while roggenbuck s videos parody the chaos and bleakness of modern life they simultaneously encourage viewers to appreciate the simplicity and wonder of grass and trees interpreting immoral authorship today some really disgusting things have been publicly exposed about past actions of mine you can search steve roggenbuck on twitter to find the posts that i am aware of at this time roggenbuck wrote in a twitter post on october i m sorry many people will now look back on my feminism as if it has been a stunt or a front meant to decieve sic people it was not a stunt it has been a sincere effort made by a flawed person the tweets to which roggenbuck refers included screenshotted messages from in the messages roggenbuck asks a then year old ashley olson if she would be interested in being his sex slave with roggenbuck proposing forceful sex acts christlover a feature in the daily beast details other similar accusations against roggenbuck exposing roggenbuck s repeated abuse of his celebrity status to exploit young women and trans people zimmerman other alt lit contributors have likewise faced claims of sexual misconduct for example in the editor of the now defunct pop serial alt lit magazine stephen tully dierks was accused of sexual abuse jones soon after tao lin was publicly accused of statutory rape and emotional abuse tsjeng roggenbuck took to his tumblr blog to respond to the claims against his peers commending victims for sharing their stories as well as writing extensively about sexual consent the final item on his list of consent tips is be aware of power imbalances content warning roggenbuck s blog post about consent followed from numerous others exploring gendered lives and issues related to feminist theory and practice for example untitled post despite his public promotion of consent roggenbuck himself appeared to struggle with the concept of course roggenbuck may have now had time to reflect upon his past behaviors and may have worked towards making more mindful decisions going forwards what matters though is that his publicly available works were produced in a context tainted by abuse however unintentional or unrecognized even if he has made efforts to change his behaviors as per his own admission the durability of digital documentation makes it so that an analysis of roggenbuck s work is incomplete without recognition of his being a flawed person roggenbuck is not bound to the reported instances but his poems contexts of creation matter because they inform our judgements of their beauty and our understandings of roggenbuck s authorial intentionality steve roggenbuck s poetry was once important for its content for its exemplification of a new generation of e literature now steve roggenbuck s poetry is also important for another reason it is important because it serves as a starting point for a discussion about issues related to the development dissemination and consumption of digital artifacts issues that will undoubtedly inform the production and reception of g e lit it exemplifies the potential darkness of digital connectivity and of the use of the web for new forms of interpersonal control alt lit as a digital born literary form was and perhaps still is a particularly well paved path to such control as ashley olson observed in an interview about how alt lit may serve as a tool for underage grooming iskander olson and karsavin alt lit grooms because it is something on a surface level that youth could relate to media that appears at first glance to be tailored for them alt lit mimics a teenaged affect establishes a more infantile or youthful voice to use as a vehicle for sometimes very violent or disturbing ideas and presents these ideas alongside ones that are relatable to adolescents with total indifference the voice of alt lit is also established through its technical convention as in the case with roggenbuck and others there are abundant grammatical errors creative misspellings emojis webspeak text that is literally copied and pasted from social media in the attempt to convey familiarity and intimacy through a relatable confessional mode readers can mistake the lack of structure and unrelenting oversharing in alt lit for vulnerability authenticity familiarity and sincerity this voice was integral to the public persona as well when i was minor whom steve solicited for sex he never dropped the childish affect it was utilized to mask or soften the violence of his behavior flores formative article about g e lit repeatedly stresses the accessibility of this new category if you count image macro memes as a kind of electronic literature as i do then the numbers of works produced and circulated are in the millions flores writes the number of practitioners is equally enormous numbering in the thousands millions if you count image macro meme makers flores article does not however recognize the social inequalities already rampant online certainly g e lit has the potential to engage a more a wide ranging and diverse audience than its categorical predecessors however we cannot ignore the fact that certain voices are amplified online while others are marginalized robinson et al we also cannot ignore the significance of familiarity established through remixing and popular culture references in g e lit that appears in our personalized newsfeeds we literally welcome g e lit practitioners into our homes when we consume their content in domestic spaces these practitioners exploit the sense of closeness that comes with familiar language and personalized consumption experiences for affective impact this impact may very well be harmful as was so in roggenbuck s case for this paper i have applied a critical reading approach to roggenbuck s work i have watched every one of roggenbuck s videos and have read most of his published works for a deep understanding of his literary style and cultural contributions other scholars however have taken critical not reading approaches to problematic authors in her explanation for not reading dfw david foster wallace in light of wallace s blatant misogyny in both his published works and personal life amy hungerford writes that i n placing my reasons and the evidence on which i base them on the table in suggesting the kinds of reasons it might be legitimate to consider as we make our best guesses about how to parcel out our reading hours i hope to draw attention to the fact that refusal can be an intentional and transparent part of professional life for the scholar hungerford s choice to not read wallace is rooted in a decision to dismiss valorization of misogynistic views perpetuated by his work and discussions about it as hungerford asks what do people want novels to do for them what kinds of thought and meaning do literary works make available what stories matter to a given culture at a given moment in history and what do they tell us about that culture wallace s works surely suggest some answers to these sorts of questions but with a contemporary work a work that is still in the process of being integrated into the culture the scholar finds herself in a different position what if we just stop talking about such a work before it matters that much to the culture at large stop reading it stop teaching it stop studying it what if we start suggesting something else to read instead instead of giving culturally problematic works and authors lip service hungerford adopts an approach that emphasizes alternatives there is after all so much to read and so little time why focus on that which was produced by the unsavory hungerford s argument is well articulated and convincing and provides a basis for future justifications of readerly refusal my opposing approach though is driven by an answer to hungerford s question about w hat stories matter to a given culture at a given moment in history it is not so much roggenbuck s work that is most important here but what roggenbuck represents in a time of transition towards an upsurge of digitally produced literature and web induced connectivity roggenbuck s public activity reflects many stories that matter in our culture right now stories about human computer collaboration for artistic output means of interpersonal communication societal perceptions of consent and questions of power dynamics in both digital and embodied space engaging with the corpus of roggenbuck s work permits nuanced comprehension of how such cultural stories may influence or be influenced by this work not talking about such stories or deflecting discussions with recommendations for alternatives does not make them go away the path towards change is paved with painful and awkward cobblestones that we must traverse to reach a more equitable destination this is a destination that g e lit practitioners and scholars should strive towards reaching whichever road is taken conclusion this paper represents my own efforts to determine the cultural value of alt lit poet steve roggenbuck s work following verified accusations of sexual misconduct made against him it also serves as an appeal for further conversations about hermeneutic processes associated with g e lit in particular works appearing on widely accessible platforms often responding to contentious contemporary issues while works of g e lit may have extraordinary positive effective and affective impact scholars must be attuned to the potentially negative social implications of g e lit practice whose voices are heard whose are not how and why what power imbalances might g e lit perpetuate or create although roggenbuck was by no means the only person forwarding the alt lit movement in its prime he was one of the most renowned establishing a widespread and dedicated fanbase by personally responding to fans comments in an eccentric and endearing way the character he cultivated to cite prathna lor provided an example of digital realism in which social media is used to produce a low poetics that is sincere and lifelike and yet ultimately fictive while roggenbuck s online character was promoting inclusive and feminist practices of consent though roggenbuck himself seemingly struggled to do the same roggenbuck was to use his own words an internet bard seizing digital opportunities for poetry production and dissemination and to be a poet while the internet exists he contemplates roggenbuck an internet bard man we got an opportunity unfortunately roggenbuck also seized inappropriate opportunities arising from his internet celebrity his choice to exercise his power in this way concluded his saga of internet fame this saga serves as a stark reminder of our responsibility as g e lit scholars and practitioners to remain diligent in maintaining inclusive and safe literary communities for all works cited boost house kickstarter https www kickstarter com
