Hello everybody.I hope you can hear me.Yes, yes. Okay, wonderful grace, just always a little bit afraid of internet connection, especially when it's raining but today it's sunny here so everything should go.Should good fine so what come to this conference today it's the law states Friday, it's very promising it's a nice, a nice truck.So I don't want to waste too much time.In, in talking myself.I prefer just to briefly introduce you, each of you and hope we have a nice debate it's very very very very promising and. But first of all land with bank Soren and Scott for this wonderful conference because I hadn't had the possibility yet to do itso let me do it. So, the first speaker today about sorry you're ready because I'm pretty sure that it will pronounce it badly.Let's, let's see Michael don't do Mikhail, maybe it's me Kyle isn't me Korean Right, right. This tendency to think that everything must be in English.No, it's me Hi, Sheila, or something like this.Or you pronounce your name yourself because I know that my pronunciation is horrible. With a very interesting topic on the paradox of electronic literature on might interested in that, in classroom investigating the challenges for new literacy practiceswithin the platform school. So Mihail just to you and I.Thank you, Savannah, and I just link my paper in the tent, so everybody can see it again.Okay. And yeah, I try to keep myself in the five limit. minutes limit, and I'm Mickey Mouse, and I'm based in the University of Queensland and literally at the border or to Austria.And so my interest is in education and educational media. And then my starting question, thinking about this paper was.Why hasn't electronic literature in the schools yet, or limit in a limited amount. And as we are speaking as we are thinking and computers have certainly entered schools and and certainly within this this pandemic times.So there is some kind of paradox to disentangle here. And my departure was to think about what are the educational types of media that are used.Many scholarscriticize or despite the situation that there are electronic books in textbooks, but they are mostly legacy media that are digitalized and bad don't and reflect the notion of digital born, literature, so they don't coincide with the broader shared notionof electronic literature as something born digitally andcontaining some, some kinds of performances that are specific to electronic literature.So then the whole question becomes, okay when, when the school right now is some kind of platform that facilitates conventional forms of educational media like textbooks, what is happening right now what kinds of platform innovations are happening rightnow. And what can be changed in order to facilitate a newer forms of electronic literature in schools.So if you talk about platforms, my second point in the paper is, and that there is much confusion about the concept of platform so what what is the platform.We are talking about different educational platforms learning management systems and so on.And actually, there are different definitions.And for example, the early paper by Ian bogus and Nick move forward.describes within platform studies, a platform as a system that can be reprogrammed and therefore customized by outside developers users and in a way adapted to countless needs and niches that the platforms, original developers could not have possiblycontemplated, then there's another perspective, which is more the educational psychology side of the debate, which defines a platform as a program programmable digital architecture designed to organize interactions between users, not just end users butalso corporate entities public parties, it is geared toward the systematic collection, I with processing circulation and monetization of user data. So there's the other aspect that, which, which is addressed here, which goes more in the direction of whatis done within these platforms and what what what is done with platforms that maybe isn't contemplated beforehand.So, if you look at the the issue right now is that many platforms arein. Nevertheless, structured integrate that follow a model of conventional schooling. So they as an author, for example, observed this reference to Google Classroom.The title tested mechanisms and structures of formal schooling and like classrooms coursework students submissions and so on, abstracted into a predefined template for participation.So what can we do in our electronic literate society to change things. I think that different issues that have to be addressed.Also, and also criticized as tokenism for example, work but by by many earlier works on the hypertext and time.And then the problem becomes when there's some kind of disruptive fixation like words like crystal Sims describes rather isproblematic ization random technical and experts and Alice imaginative represent figured words that are politically amenable to in control with the with ambition to rebel remedy so if the, if you envision a world which is do which electronic literatureis the only solution, we fall in the trap of technological solution ism and simplification like simplified business of the different digital native for example.The second issue is about literacy, there's much to say about literacy, because the concept of reading, I think, later on in this banner we will talk about it more is very confusing because.And we can also refer to the consumption of digital artifacts, as interacting, or playing. So what is the reading part of it and where does literacy begin and end and the whole concept of literacy has to be, we, we considered, especially in schools andright now the tendency is to go backwards to to basic reading and writing, because it's the most clearest type of conceding in literacy.And then the third issue is teaching.So, all the teachers.a lot of electronic literaturehappens outside of schools and.and only concentrate on learning. And what happens is that the agency of teachers and students and gets missed. and the vision of.I portray and my papers and teachers becoming more like cyber Bart's themselves instead of being standardized with learning management systems for example.So yeah, this is the. These are the issues I bring forward in my paper and maybe we can talk about it more than, yeah.Thank you.Thank you very much, Mikhail, a very very interesting topic. I think that, yes, we can we can absolutely discussing this later.I think dash now should be are not yet oven bar. I'm a right.But I cannot see her. Right.Well, well done.I don't know so me. I think we, we, we go for you. And, and that's it. So me Spencer will just not amplified publishing finding audiences.I'm very into this founding audiences because, well, it's also linked to ready to watch Mikhail said, because it's elite I think just being for too long.In a niche, so this finding audiences is very promising just like I'm silence, and we'll discuss later. Thank you, me, great and I wanted to share some slides Do I have the should be able, God if Nitasha me think I probably can.Yes. Can you see that, yes, just.Can you just see the first slide, is the best light.And so, my name is Amy Spencer, I a postdoctoral research at at Boston University which is in the UK in the southwest of the UK.And I'm just going to run through some of the key points of my paper which I realized wasn't linked, but I'm just gonna get me Sorry to interrupt you to know how you want to, to, to present this, this is not if I see all the papers, not just the firstline so I don't know. Okay, let me see what I've done. Okay, now it's perfect. Okay, thanks. Okay, I can't see my notes at the same time which is nothing but anyway, I'll be fine.But anyway, it'll be fine. And so, I'm fine publishing sharing audiences.So the Amplified publishing project is.It's a large scale project it's part of the Bristol bath creative r&d project which is a sort of practice based practice lead approach to research, where we provide funding and commission, producers, writers, theatre makers.All kinds of creative technologists, people who are working in the creative technology sector to develop projects and and explore research. So, it's a big project and employee publishing is one strand of it and that's the strand that I'm involved with,we're thinking about publishing is broader sense so not just, you know, traditional book publishing print publishing thinking about all forms of content sharing content across different platforms.So that's why I was particularly interested in this yellow strand theme this year.So it's looking at lots of different questions, and my role within the project is to explore these different avenues, thinking about what publishing means in the 21st century, you know, it's not just print anymore it's, you know, it might include publishingon YouTube might include Tick Tock it might include you know all these different platforms that that are available and thinking about how you might expand traditional media through synchronization, that you can move through different platforms you don'tneed to kind of stay on one platform and consume everything you can kind of move between platforms and get different bits of content and thinking about personalization so how how you interact with the platform.How it sort of Taylor's content to who you are and what you're you're you're interested in thinking about the rise of visual storytelling so not necessarily focused on the printed word, for example, thinking about a range of more visual platforms andhow how that might influence the future of reading and thinking about who our audiences are, this is the crucial question that I've focused on in my research in the moment, who are the audience is what do they want.Where do we find them. So, this is something that, you know, so many different people who are working in publishing and thinking about publishing and it's broader sense where the audience is what does that mean.So that's what I'm currently exploring and thinking about narrative based digital publishing because that's my background so my background is specifically around kind of experimental fiction and how you can explore kind of narrative based fiction butSo how can narrative based digital publishing reach an active and engaged engaged and active and engaged audience across platforms so looking for an audience, not just a passive audience but it kind of active receptive responsive audience.So these are the questions that I've been exploring in my paper so how can we, as experiences be guided and mediated and kind of can't just throw a new form a reader that needs to be some kind of sense of supporting you in some way to understand whatthe form is that can be done in lots of different ways.How can an algorithm algorithms be used to find a new and relevant content, we've identified that's a crucial area that algorithms are very important in searching and finding finding work, how capitalization help me to find what they're looking for.So, again, quite crucial and something that, as we've talked to publishers through our project that comes up again and again. And how can platforms be developed and frame so how can people only navigate different platforms, but how can they sort of respondto readers and readers understand.Why can't I mean.So yeah, so we're doing this as part of the appsflyer Publishing project, and one of the ways that we've done this, is we're commissioning 15 I think moment and research fellows and industry partners.Research fellows and industry partners. And so we've got a range of different people we've got, for example, a children's author who's really interested in developing Audio Stories but for children that are very inclusive.We've got publishers who are interested in finding new readers and trying to work out how to position themselves in the digital.We've got theatre makers trying to understand how story and narrative are being developed in that field so we've got lots of different people all with a different research question.And my role is to kind of partly support that research, as it develops and engage with my own research in that area so I'm particularly thinking about narrative based publishing, and thinking about this, reaching audiences.And my experience in this is influenced quite heavily by my involvement in the ambient literature project, which was a two year project where I was a postdoc, and I just put a little definition of what Ambien literature is so situated literary experiencesdelivered by pervasive computing platforms, responding to the presence of reader to deliver story. So that was again a practice lead project where we commissioned writers to develop works, and we asked them to develop works that use smartphone technologyso they sort of experimented and played with different sensors in the phone for example, GPS but alsoother, so your phone Nicole knows where you are, but also knows what time of day it is what the weather's like all the different kind of data that it collects about you as you're moving through the world.And this project.We encourage writers and readers to experiment with that.Those kinds of technologies and develop really sort of immersive stories that you engage with through your phone so my at my starting point for the upside publishing project was thinking about this, and some of the things I learned, as I was going throughthis project.And so I've just put a few findings so these are my initial kind of areas that I've started to explore so that until like publishing project is, is there any started a while ago it's, it's, it's new.It's kind of in its beginning phases at the moment we're engaging with people we're beginning to research we're talking with people it's a kind of a new thing.and my initial areas that I've think I'm going to look into in a bit more depth which I've been outlining so writers need to find a way to guide their readers and it's something that we found in the Amplified publishing project.As right in the ambit literature project they've got similar names they keep modeling them up and in the digital project was writers need to support readers, particularly the beginning stages of the story kind of setting out what the mechanisms are, youknow, how are you going to do that, to prevent readers just getting very confused.So that that helps kind of reaching audiences through making things clear and understandable and avoiding kind of elite projects becoming quite niche and only appealing to a smaller audience, making it understandable that needs to be a connection to existingplatforms, that's something that we've been exploring and thinking about that. This ties into discover ability.People need to kind of understand where to find works access needs and inclusion need to be taken into account that was something that we learned particularly through the literature project, you know not everybody access is works in the same way.so you need to be responsive and able to support various needs, and also works might not be for everyone. So that's something that comes up when you're looking for new audiences for work it you know might not be that the work is, you know, widely appealsto everybody, it might be a kind of niche, a niche work, and you're thinking about what that means in terms of finding readings and finding all the answers.Okay. As a quick fire approach to what I've been working on.I'm going to share my screen.Okay, thank you. Now you can hear me. Sorry, I'm very very very interesting.So since.I think it will have time for discussion very happy about that because normally.Normally people's now, we can also discuss all together because of lack of time versus your stay strictly to your timing said it's perfect. So, now, it's not very interesting, interesting to know the story that topic, but I cannot see.I forgot my glasses so in class. So I have some job. Now you can see it was I have some toggles anyway.Eager course yet and solid Russell.I did there. No, we haven't been been.They haven't told us anything so we lost to track, so we have plenty of time to discuss that right.Oh that's that's bad.Yeah, it's not there they have some problem connecting, I don't know,probably not. So, it's just us. Well, well then we have lots of time to talk about your your your your both your view. So if you want to add anything Mihail, and also me to better explain because you were very strict to the point, but since we have moretime I think it's a fair enough to give you.We're back so you can explain a little bit more, because in fact is the connection between the two the two, you're looking for audiences and Mihail is looking for for for materials like say leave this sir.It's interesting if you might add something me fail because you had a paper but you were very very rigorous, and I'm YouTube. So, you might talk for another five minutes may be an me YouTube and then we started discussion a couple of questions, and probablyalso other other vendors have some some question and particularly interesting in that, especially here in Italy since you are the border but the University of Toronto.Still is still on this side, although I don't like borders because of my own own own history of travel around Europe.But I'm particularly interesting also interested in, also to see if you know about any differences between,between what is going on in the. Let's go, German side of Italy and the rest of Italy if you have any, any detail that you can share with us if you are where the fish are interested in that and I'm silent otherwise it's me speaking all the time.Yeah.Yeah, I can, I can start maybe.Yeah, the, I think is the thing is in Germany and then Austria and also neatly.We have this more or less the same situation of educational media being more oriented at the conventional types of media so so what what is happening right now is that because of the pandemic and homeschooling and so on.They're much more platforms and during the schools. So what, what hasn't been conceivable maybe three years ago, and during a Google Classroom entering a primary school.I have two kids in primary school so so I see it also as a parent, but you can see is that platforms aren't in primary schools and, and maybe in Germany there's more skepticism aboutproperty proprietary platforms or platforms that don't respect this privacy and they're more and more concerned a little bit more concerns, but the overall picture I think is more or less the same.To what what I'm what appeared to me, listening to Amy was, how, how maybe the distinction between authorship and audience is put into question by by electronic literature because, especially if you see works like ambient literature or augmented realitygames or labs and so on. And that is not only the author and the consumer but there's also a middle part of in on it and this is the interesting part for me because if you talk about this Zubin literature for example there's always the parent to readto the kids.And with educational media in schools, there's always the teacher who facilitates or elaborates the material so how can the role of the future be be adapted in the future maybe with works that are more experimental a more embodied also More, more, multimodal.So the question becomes, then, okay but what what is the distinction between the author and how much authorship is given to these middle worlds in betweens to the teachers and, and so on.Yeah, maybe. Yeah, this, this can be one question.Yeah, I think I found that really interesting thinking about it was something that came up over and over again through an Ambien literal project, you know, is someone a reader is someone a you know a co writer, kind of what is the position of the readerwithin a work like that. So, when you said that that kind of engaged with a lot of the thinking that I've been doing, whether yet yeah the position, who's the writer who's the reader who's the.Yeah, in kind of interactive works where you're,you're, you're not kind of a passive type of reader.Yeah, all those boundaries kind of blow that, and I think they're really, really crucial to understanding these kind of works a lot of the time, particularly in that.And being a big project where your presence was really important you needed to be part of the story you needed in some of the, the works that we commissioned needed to be walking a particular route in order to engage with the story so you were you wereyou were crucial crucial part of the storyThree questions and think, very interesting. So, the first one is by Hannah governments and then so thank you very much for your presentation your projects are of course very focused on elite in different contexts that which I find very interesting andby the way, do you have any advice for other researchers in elite on how to incorporate different context behind academia, and the elite community.This is why also with that little bit less of the projects that I've been working on.Engage with publishing, and quite heavily. So kind of moving beyond a lot of projects are sort of focused on industry, and I think there's a bit of a move within the universities in in the UK to be working in partnership with, with different industries.And I'm do quite a lot of work around.Working with publishers and sort of technology companies, which I think for me is a really nice way of working in academia and working on projects that I find interesting in a kind of academic sense but also getting to work with people developing thosein a practical sense as well so I do a lot of work with PR practitioners, it's a sort of practitioner focused way of working where you're reaching out of academia, and you're thinking about developing and making works, and lots of researchers that I workwith have a kind of dual identity so they might be kind of theatre makers as well or writers or practitioners of different kinds of working on, you know, minted reality works or via works or, you know, all different kinds of things so I think findingof research, where people are kind of making as well for me is a really crucial part of research, and it might be that you can find a similar kind of way of working, I don't know if it's specific to the UK, or whether that's a way that that research worksin a kind of worldwide context but for me I found that that's a really interesting way so the projects I've worked on we've commissioned work, and then we've researched the work, which has been really, really nice but it also involves working with differentpeople who are interested in different things, is the wave crucial to me.And we do do do do you have any idea, especially among us because we're both from Italy and back to Italy, after so many years of burrows, and I see that here in Italy, there is this some kind of resistance, but they are really, I would say, afraid, butbut it's Sophie so different that probably didn't knew how to cope with this we deal with it. And so, my personal experience, inside, outside, did the Academy, the Academy, and I would like to go outside Academy especially working with school, high schoolbut not just high school but has alsoelementary schools and I can promote our school.I think that they, when I talk with colleagues or anything they look at me like the system.They don't know how to approach it, or I'm mistaken something that you have been more experienced me trial, but you think. Yeah, and it's it's interesting problem becausethe mentality is oriented, or they're not many examples of electronic literature for for children or published works that can be applied for for pedagogical contexts.And, and, and also the problem is maybe that there aren't any business models that are feasible or that that work in this publishing scheme that it's, it's remained much appropriate to me so.So I think an interesting way to promote things or go forward is to attach connect to the Open Educational Resources movements and, and to look at communities of practice that produce their own material or their own artifacts like, for example, and progressiveeducation movements and in France for example this. The first a movement and they, and they're always thinking about self publishing and self, making that the materials.Another point in Italy is, I think, though, children's literature and sector. And because if you think, for example about Sanibel daddy was a very famous student, author, you need to leave it had this tender hundred year birthday last year, so it wasreally a big topic here. And the thing about Daniel daddy is that many of his concepts and how he describes for example in the, in his book, The grammar of fantasy.Many of these concepts and are like in the intermediate step towards electronic literature because once the one thing he said is the best. The best story is to start with without, without an ending which can be interactively extended by by the child inthe room in the classroom, or by the tap and so, so there's always this creative component in any student works. And I think if we can, for example, when I approach.Teachers primary teachers. I normally go and go by citing these kinds of books because they're actually works that that have something in common with electronic literature.Yeah.Sorry, I didn't open mic mic.Okay, so do we have another question you might have already read it. I will love to hear you both speak a bit more about how Elise might be used to encourage into personal understanding and meaningful social connections.It seems like this is a key underlying point for both all your papers and also this is more directly to me but you probably already answered because I saw that you were chopping also me is your paper available anywhere.Yes, she she sent a link I think, if not, could you provide any relevant links to amplified publishing project and this conversation seems to fit well into.I want to read dash, because I am afraid that I will want tables to pre beats Becka could be that that no sure paper on ambient literature, which is currently being presented in another paper.Yeah.She's a colleague of mine working a boss, but she's also tell me how how her name should be pronounced. I said, Well, I've got is her first name I have never said her name.Okay. Next, okay. That's okay, I don't want to guess right now, but um yeah she's working on.She's also part of the publishing project thinking about the art and literature so literary works.That used to be our. So, yeah, interesting researcher.I included a link to the outside publishing project and I can.Okay, perfect.And going back to the question. Yeah. I'm not sure if the answer discussion, and the encouraging into personal understanding and meaningful social connections.And it's tricky because I work with in the projects I've been working with we work with writers and technologists and they're all developing different projects and some of those are really crucially focused on social connection and particularly around.Lots of people that we've worked with thinking about kind of urban spaces and how you can build connection within, within place as a particular research interest of mine how you can you know make spaces that might have first feel quite anonymous buildingsort ofkind of meaningful social connection, one of the writers that we've worked with as part of the Ambien literature literature project, Duncan speak when he produces audio works that I really think interesting in the way that they connect the person experiencingthem to place, so you can works with sort of ideas of serendipity. And so you're walking through a city and you might be listening to headphones headphones and reading some text at the same time and.And the way that he sort of choreographs what you might see around you so he you know is aware of the, the common items in inner city space and he sort of incorporates them in the story so as you're walking you get this sense of somebody of later trailfor you and that you get a sense that the story is choreographed with the things that you see in front of you so I really like works like that that you know digital works that you know couldn't be couldn't exist without digital technologies, but theygive you that feeling of connection, social connection and connection to place, but through, through digital works.Yeah, I'm into those kind of works.Think you know if you.We have been adopted by thatwas trying to badly describe it was hard to describe it without describing huge amount of things but yet so wonderful work that one.Okay.I don't know Michael. Michael, maybe you can go to you with an English name, we hire.Why do you want to add anything yeah I can add maybe something which is a very broad issue in my, my PhD and research is because it's in the field of media education and I think the interesting thing about electronic literature, or these kinds of digitalworks is that they portray the mediated ness of interpersonal connections. So normally, when we interact with each other in social networks and social media in these kinds of things get invisible, you get used to this.And these kinds of things get invisible, we get used to this algorithm and norms and, and we forget or humans generally forget, and how these are mediated and then, how, how is the platform, how the platform is actually conditioning and interpersonalconnections. So what is interesting, I think, is that children already can interact with these kinds of works in order to see how is it to talk to a computer and not presume that the computer, or, and be aware of the, of the issues that arise so computersdon't understand anything. And so, or don't understand everything, or if you go to Siri, or other interpreters, they don't understand everything. And so, making these kinds of issues, more visible.I think is one step to, to look to promote and the personal connections, and because right now are the personal connections are always mediated somehow by it by digital media and reflecting on it and being able to reflect upon it is very important tobe more and more important and I thought this is a very important area to to work on.Thank you I I totally agree. I think that in this literature can really help a critical thing you knows like thinking how the interface is they're wise they're thinking of water and cruising was like they think data.Social media tends to let you think, let us think that there is no interface there that that's the real life and women it's real life but there is an interface there, but they will call it interface let's say you don't feel that there is an interfacethere. Why, at least in, in some electronically to literary works that the interface is there and you have to cope with it.It reminds you that mean the recent mediation, some innovative things yeah i think that you're perfectly right and that could be very.An important aspect to to to to develop more and schools, and not just in the academy just to research this but to practically experiment this with audience in general, but maybe in the schools and particular.Other questions from from from the audience. I don't know maybe you want to ask something to each other.Okay, Jason yes please, without writing, just getting.I wanted to, I was really interested by both these papers I have, you know, more than one question if if there's time but for me the question of literacy is very interesting to me because I teach electron literature at the at the university level butyou know I'm not sure if you have experience of teaching this to K 12 but I find their literacy when it comes to email it to be completely non existent.It's like, you know, you know you can you can you can expect them to read you know you know you can expect that they know how to read but when it comes to a lot of electronic literature, it's really astonishing.You know, they might know how to use like a ps4 controller, but you know, give them a work of interactive fiction or or anything like that and they're completely stymied.And I'm and wondering.One thing I was when I was looking at your paper.I was wondering, because this is you know my solution is that I actually get them to become procedural authors themselves I actually get them to create using platforms because I find that's really the only way to really get over that literacy problemis to make is to basically expose them to what it's like to create using those platforms and. And by doing so they gain. I think a better understanding of what's involved in these works.And do you think that would work also at the k 12 k 12 level, basically assignments that got them to actually createworks of he led broadly, broadly construed.And, yeah, I think it's certainly the way forward.One issue I think in the digital literacy is is that we have not yet developed the right terminology so so works of digital books are either interacted with or played with, but we assume that people are naturally inclined to interact and play, and theydon't have to know anything to interact, okay, but to read something we have to know something. So there's the literacy issue is disappearing from from the horizon and then we see actually okay.And in order to enjoy electronic literature, we have to have some kind of literacy here and there has to be some kind of understanding, and we have to promote these kinds of understanding in school, already in the earlier classes earlier.Also, also Primary School also before and maybe. And, yeah, the. There are many ways of, of getting students to program the whole work of similar poppers and construction ism revolves around this.Andthere were also problems with this because,and children are not able to naturally program so so thatyet. There's not yet a pedagogy, for having them do these kinds of things.Within school and rest, and finding the right places within school to do these things because in school we start with informatics maybe after primary school and in before, this, this, it's only MEDIA EDUCATION or.stance, so be be aware and what children are told what they don't have to do in the internet but the creative aspect is missing. And so I think yeah i agree very much that the creative aspect is the main way forward to to tackle these kinds of issues.Yeah, absolutely. I don't know if you have read the chart.Like courting an animated Allison was so lovely lovely.Open Access experimental sources from 44444 professional colleagues, I have one colleague of mine and unfortunately she is moderating right now on the other fun that would have loved to be here because actually the orator Dominic, and she she she sheshe teachers teacher to teach electronic literature to in schools so she Well, she, she used the electronic literature to teach us the languages and now I'm not a two languages it's Caitlyn so it's bigger than that.But, briefly, so she would have been very interested in that and of course in any material is wasa perfect example yeah but I'm afraid Dasha.It has moved to being proprietary Yes, that's that's true. And, well, they did an amazing work and, of course, somehow, this is another aspect about trying to listen to when we sometimes discuss but just as an really focused on to to watch that also isreally trying to literature normally share for free or the words that how they're supposed to leave.I mean, many of them are scholars or predictions that already have some other kind of job but they cannot leave on that. So, and this is also a tricky, a tricky point but drop.For more comments. For God my glasses This is horrible that anyway.Now, to talk a lot about cost of production and you need to recovery dash, I was exactly thinking on dash.And, okay, me yeah of course you know, K, I was just thinking it was interesting how that works. Yeah.It's amazing, but Jasmine I I totally agree with you. This year I also try to do the same with my students but it's totally different because I don't teach literature I teach digital culture at the Department of design.So, I was trying to work with designers. And actually, they come up with brilliant design solutions.But the moment you understand this literary is that in literally in our training literature I was a little bit. Let me be are nerds, they are very capable to do things.And even when they were like analyzing works with the trick thing, I started. One of the lecture of that with elegant elegant Clifford's that are knows you know their their work this way toward etc.The sweet old etc. which is a little bit tricky if you don't know what to do. And in fact, they were like kind of nervous, they did, they were able to generate tax and everything, but in this tricky tax they were kind of, oh my supposed to work here.So, this is also quite interesting to me, which I tend to want to up depression nomics Yes, so I didn't know that there is any other comments or questions.Can I jump in.Yes please please please.I don't know if you thought I'll turn my camera on sorry I've been eating lunch, as this panel thing going on and I'm really, I was drinking it was trying,trying.I mean I was eating spaghetti so it is the least appealing thing to watch someone eat so for everyone's sake.But this has been a fantastic panel and up a part of me is really glad actually that it's just the two of you because I think we've, we've pulled out such a rich conversation here and I'm really pleased with that and I think this is I'm going to be theobnoxious person who's like this is more of a comment than a question, but I think I really wanted to bounce off what Jason said about this idea of critical making, I also teach, he lit to undergraduates in a digital media program so I'm in Media Studiesstudies program and these students have next to no understanding of what is going on behind the scenes, or even superficially and to get them to make.And to get them to look at the code and really play with it themselves and get into understanding how it works. It's fantastic. And the comment I wanted to make was just that both of you in different ways, and definitely am super soft skills work that'sbeing presented in the panel, and at the same time.What I really like about this work is that it's, it's welcoming the reader or the person who's experiencing into the conversation. And I think this is what really frustrates me with a lot of Isla conversations and where he let as a field has really failed,and it needs to do better. is it so focused on the person making the artifact it's so focused on the authorial intention and I know, Amy, you and I, a long time ago and had this conversation where I think that's a load of garbage, I I do read a responsestudies as my area, and I'm more interested in what the reader has to say I kind of don't care what what the author says, and I think when we're talking about our students don't have literacy Well, actually, maybe, maybe the fault is partially with theperson writing the thing.If you're not making yourself understood.You have a responsibility as as a writer as a producer to, to meet your audience at will be somewhere in the middle doesn't even have to be halfway, but a lot of what I find is, is I struggle with it because I'm like, this isn't for me.This is some sort of self indulgent exercise where you're trying to work out your thoughts, and that's fantastic but it's actually not for me at all. And I think both of you I just, I think I just like to hear you speak a little bit more about how readersare involved and we talked about literacy, Amy, obviously Ambien literature is a really embodied experience, I would just I'm interested to see what amplified publishing is going to do, because they have so much expertise there in that area, how they'regoing to bring that expertise into this project Mihail I'm really interested in seeing how we can further kind of reader response exercises in educational context.So, kind of a comment but more of just please tell me more because I would love to keep learning from you.And Jason as well if you want to chime in, by all means, please Yes, and just please just open your microphone and get in because soon as means the few of us, and at least I don't have to readformulated my thoughts on this yet but I totally agree with you that the kind of self indulgent nature of some works definitely is off putting and that's kind of what a lot of my work is sort of reacting against.And, yeah, I don't know whether it's to do with sort of the intention of the offer, or the platforms that people are using, or you know what it is but a lot of the works that I'm particularly interested in all those more sort of embodied immersive worksbut whether the reader or the you know the person experiencing it has a much more active role, and that's definitely something that the Amplified publishing project is really, it's quite.What's the word. It's the word isn't quite commercial but it's, you know, thinking about sort of the publishing industry so it's quite interesting focused and it's.Yeah, I don't think there would be much room for works that are were to sort of self indulgent and weren't kind of clearly focused on, you know, finding a market, it's about sort of exploring your markets and ways of commercially publishing things sofor example the writer who's thinking about audio storytelling and using kind of voices systems like Alexa, to, to share children's stories that you know is very much focused on the audience very much focused on who's going to buy that what's that goingto be like, you know all those kind of questions, is what we're thinking about.Yeah, so how do you directly market something, how do you find audiences. It sounds kind of overly commercial but I think that's, that's just a bit of a lip that needs exploring the how to find audiences and readers and be quite upfront about that asan intention.We're also touching on like conversations that are ongoing in the publishing world as well, like, it's great to have these, these works but how are you going to make money off of them. Yeah, yeah, definitely so a lot of the projects that I've been involved with we've been working directly with publishers and, and the tendency for publishers to seethe tendency for publishers to see it as a sort of marketing thing so there's a printed book, and then there might be an app or something you know something that accompanies the, the work but it not being the main the main work so I don't know the answersto any of the questions that we're raising around that because otherwise I would maybe be doing it.I don't think anyone knows the answers and it kind of goes through different phases where publishers are very interested in technology and an experiment of it and then, you know, times when it isn't happening as much and it's yet hard to read what thetrends are sometimes.Yeah, that part of what we're focusing on is, is definitely that commercial aspect.I would just, you know, maybe add that, you know, I think the problem is kind of literacy and you know, being able to navigate these types of works, one of the major problems just the pace of technology, right you know it's like, you know, you might havegrown up playing interactive fiction you know how to play interactive fiction you know what you know you know that's the bet you give that to someone who's never played interactive fiction and they're completely like sort of you know just baffled rightand so the dilemma I always have is you know, especially we want to teach historical works to be led, you know, either you're obviously dealing with types of, you know, interaction that you know have become obsolete and so you can't expect, you know studentsat 20 years old to, you know, know these technologies so it's a kind of an interesting dilemma and I always quote.At the beginning of my course I always use is is about faith knows, great article that basically you know essentially says, look, you know, if we want to grow.We have to develop a literacy specific to that right because it's so easy just to dismiss this stuff is sort of you know crass and juvenile and, you know, and uninteresting, but that says more about us as readers and it says anything about the work itselfso there's I don't think there's an easy solution to that but you know I think that's always a kind of constant, constant problem right and you know I find this a promise like you know I can assign works that you know I'm terrible with you know videogame, modern video game controllers you know I can't use those things, you know, so it's it's it's a real problem.And then you told me can you mentioned, digital born for dances, and I thought that was particularly interesting that you were. I jotted it down, but I yeah you're thinking about technologies that weren't being used in schools yet and digital born, andI wondered if you had any more thoughts around what those differences might be in the work that you've done because that might help thinking around this particular I also teach undergraduates, this kind of work and, and it's always a problem knowing what.Yeah, what do you think they are, what a digital phone. In your opinion, yeah I think we can look at these performances from different perspectives. And if I look at expressive performances I always look at this theme of Janet Murray and looking at digitalbooks, being able to be participants prosody world spatial and insight, cubic and and I think this is a key point because legacy books are paper based media can be maybe some of them.Some of these performances they have maybe, and but not all four of them.So this is maybe the difference or business, this is a way to describe the main difference between an older media and digital bond kind of media that are able to, to use these kinds of performances.And then these performances, also provide some kind of difficulties and and the last comment actually made me think about paper I cited in my paper in by cognitive reading, researchers undermined and added and funded bill.Why don't read, read, hypertext novels.And this paper is actually quite interesting to read it and I think it's very important to take it seriously but I don't agree with what they say what they say that the main departure point is that hypertext literature has failed because we already talkedabout some of the reasons because early hypertext literature was experimental, it was maybe self indulgent, it was confusing and and if you give a kid today to child.One of the early forms of electronic digital but maybe they have difficulties with it.So, but but their main conclusion was then to, to say okay, we are not cognitively adapt to cope with these kinds of works because we are inclined to have to need this kind of hierarchical relationship between fixed author and passes reader and then II don't agree with that. This thing either so I think here, there's much work to do and to to disentangle. How can be, how can we produce works digital books that are readable understandable.Also with maybe a limit for readers that are beginning for readers that don't have all this literacy, even if you have yet to define what we mean by that.And, and, and this is a big challenge I think to to use all these performances in a way that is cognitively also not overwhelming. Yeah.I just want to step seven and say, I love that article.The guy who gave me my PhD he's one who evaluated my PhD so I'm really familiar with that work and i i agree with him in a lot of ways and we have I think you brought you brought up a lot of really good points that I agree with as well so if you wantto write a response to that article, I will read it.But I just want to say thank you so much for a great discussion, I have to have a meeting and, but if anyone has any work they want to send my way by all means like keep me in this conversation please and really interested in what you have to say.So thank you so much, we're going to head out that great to see you again. Thank you.On, on data I would, I would argue that married Oh Diana would say just an iPad text is readable when his career isn't if it lacks of clearances, then it's difficult to read, I would, I would extend this to to to too many others, electronic literary texts,I mean if there is clearance down Dan the reader is stuck there wants to know more, if there is no coherence, maybe your she has lost the so is less interested in that, I don't know, that's my personal opinion what we still have a few minutes, if thereis any other questions or things you to would like to discuss on also and Jasmine or Jennifer, David.Just, just to name the few of them that they can see on the screen, be.I could ask a question of Amy, and this is just kind of informational question.I'm just really interested how you go about it what kinds of creators, you end up working with and and how that happens like to do to find people who have already worked in this space or, or do they approach you or how familiar are they with using thetechnologies that completely new to them. I'm just very curious about how those kinds of partnerships happen yeah so they work in different ways so when I was part of the ambient literature project, we approached three writers who are working in quitedifferent ways in the field so keep the ledger long history in Detroit and then can speak men who had a really interesting.audio storytelling.Audio walk background.And then a travel writer.James athlete travel writer. So, approaching people directly you had no understanding of technology but also writers so an interesting crossover. And then for the publishing project we had an open callto find people to work with.To find research fellows and reset partners, we had a quite.It's quite tightly defined program because it's part of a wider program that explores different themes.over three four year project.So that was a much more open process and people applied and we knew talk to them about their ideas so there's lots of different ways of doing it and I've kind of worked in different.Different forms, both seemed to work well. I think it's a. I like the openness of asking people to submit openly and you end up with really interesting people that you might not have thought of working with.Yeah, that.Were there any qualifications in the old way to date, did you specify that they had to have a certain skill center.That one was quite open.We, they had to be within a particular geographic region of the UK so they had to be from Bristol or bath in the southwest because part of the aim of the project was to sort of develop the region as a hub for creative technology so they had to be froma particular place.They had to the main thing we asked was, for them to have a research question, but question that they wanted to explore.And then we kind of went through an interview evaluation process where we we did draw on you know what their background was and what they were interested in doing it was partly research fellows, but also industry partners so as part of that process wewere looking for people working from from industry to work with as well so it's quite broad we've ended up with a really interesting bunch of people, and they go through this year long process together where they think about their research questions theymight develop work, they might build something you know he might make something, and at the end they can apply for prototyping money to develop something that they might have.Yeah, it's a fantastic project, I think it's great you're supporting people with resources to develop interesting work, and then making connections so we've got industry, sort of these major industry partners as part of the project we've got Epic Games.The BBC bt which is a telecommunications company so we've got lots of sort of interesting minds that we can draw on and tap on and the people that we're working with can engage with those, those bigger partners, which I think is quite valuable.So yeah, we can connect them with Epic and they can talk about things they want to do.So maybe. Yeah so fun, fun project. But yeah, thank you for asking more about that.Okay, thank you so much, can we still have a couple of minutes boss.To know dry and he had a question it has been a very interesting conversations and discussion.I love it. I mean I'm sorry for the other speakers that couldn't attend the conference or private thing is fine. Gosh, I would say like, like, Leo I prefer like this, like this we had time to discuss them to to have kind of a seminary or way to to doanything bad although many speakers and then it may be a couple of questions and not getting too much into it, I actually prefer this way there know if there is no questions.What are the pathways they are opening up from the publishing industry for returning us out. Well, David, yes.Yeah.Have you read it to me.It's a big question for the end. Well the pathways for electronic literature.I'm trying to think.It shifts and changes so often so sometimes there are more opportunities than others. So for a while, you know all publishers wanted, lots of apps for all different things you every book have to have an app and then it kind of shifted in a different way.So, There are opportunities for innovation.But often, thinking the publishing industry there's often not a lot of money to sort of try new things, because, you know, so kind of old industry based on selling print books, a lot of the time soit's.it kind of needs to make commercial sense for people to innovate and the sort of inclination to do that kind of shifts and changes depending on you know economic climates and all kinds of things and trends and stuff so pathway sometimes, open up and thenthey close again they open and close game that's my experience over the last few years of being involved in that.There's lots of interesting, I think, innovation, in, in other industries, so a lot of the work that I researched this kind of crossover with people working in theater and kind of immersive theater.Not necessarily electronic literature, but really interesting use of technology.You know creative ways of thinking about VR and AR, and sort of immersive by normal sound and all those kind of things. There's lots of seems to be a lot of innovation in that area it's kind of in a tangent but, um, yeah.Carry on with it. I've always been kind of curious about how the tablet form develops and how they're being there was a separate kind of technological development that to get towards the, you know, really kind of inflexible digital platform that a lotof print books were delivered on and it seemed like we had the opportunity with mobile technologies to have something that was, you know, much more flexible but nothing was really built into the ones that were really proprietorial for delivering booksthat allowed for interactive literature and seems like we're doing a large kind of work around by trying to get other kinds of technologies into people who are really centered on on books, whereas the technology that the book industry developed is soinflexible.I just wonder if you guys are doing any, any work around that particular kind of hardware problem.And I'm not necessarily but I do recognize it to be things that, you know people like print books and really committed to that and then trying to push.Hey, do this other thing, interact with it in different ways, might be that the those particular audiences aren't receptive.And they might be more over that with people who are interested in games, then people who are interested in books at times.I haven't thought too much about hardware in my research.Yeah Jason's put in the chat.Yeah, so that Jason that was a great tool for that yeah that could be you could reset resource to put in the direction of I don't know if Miguel has any other thoughts.Okay, now I have to be the moderator. Just one minute.I had to be the bad girl.David was so nice to see you, by the way, we haven't seen for for for quite long, very happy to see you.Thanks again, and.Well, now the few minutes of break boss dinner. I have another panel I have my own Tanner to to moderate now in a few minutes on women elite gendering beats if you are interested in, otherwise the program is very very intense and offers lots of interestingpanels as well. Great to see you. Thanks for sharing your ideas with us. and thank you all.
