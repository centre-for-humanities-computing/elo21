 marsh I came back late, but I was wondering if you could tell you a little bit more about the plans for the electronic literature Center and in Poland is that going to be Cracow based project or about. You should probably also. get in touch with Joe tabby about the consortium for electronic literature. Yes, and we talked a little bit about stuff like this, but. It would be good for whatever sort of database or. archive that you end up developing out of it for to go out of the box, be able to work with the soul search engine. I think i'll stop the recording now i'm Irish if that's okay.
