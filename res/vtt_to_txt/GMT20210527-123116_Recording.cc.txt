Well I think it's, it's almost time, it's 830. At least here in Annapolis, and we should tell the administrators that we are ready to start I think that's what I was told.Shall we communicate via chat. Ok, ready to start.Very good.All right.Well, hello everybody welcome to the panel elite and its myriad of platforms for a critical approach to language, culture and digital literacy.This panel addresses three scenarios where the teaching and learning of elite has proven to be a challenging guess productive path to the teaching of language literature literature and digital literacy to, it has broaden horizons for educators and studentsalike, the presentations focus on our pedagogical experiences on teaching elite, and are using elite as a tool to train elementary and high school, educators in Valencia, Spain, and on teaching elite at the university level in one institution in Spain,and in one institution in the US, the panel will start with a presentation. Understanding elite as a tool for digital literacy for teacher training and elementary and high school level by director Dominic.Follow by breaking the mold or text, new text, same reading the paradoxes of teaching digital text through the prism of a traditional text by Dr. Maria.a foreign languages and cultures by me paralysis on Henry. So what I thought. We are looking forward to welcome you and to listen to your presentation.Okay, Pamela Thank you. I am going to share the screen with my presentation here.I am going to share this light Sunday below Rafi, so you can review the numbers on the, quote, later.Well, I am a teacher training advisor in the violence and education department in Spain and have been teaching Catalan language and Catalan data in the public educational system as a high school teacher since 2001.I am a fine artist, and when anyone studied biology in Spanish universities.I little is learn about teaching in 2006 I see nap for an online master's degree led by Professor level double bass master's degree which been online forced me to make my voice, and my writing head, in order to make myself, percent Coming from our schoolThat master's degree was not just about subjects to study assignments and readings, it was made up of discussions in forums, our reflection of reading electronic little town, sharing, every discovery with classmates from all around the world, learningfrom teachers but also from each other.They must this change the way I learned. As you can see, it also changed the way I teach my high, high school talent.Considering that I proposed to a teacher training center teaching a basic training course on reading on screens that included electronic Lita. I am presenting an overview of the six courses I taught from 2015 to 2021.Why didn't is not easy. Let's take a moment to think about the teaching and learning process you are involved with this overview of my teaching six to be very close to understand, as grammar defines it as teaching is a human practice tied to a centralinstitution, such as this school is as well you have experienced it during the lockdown.So, all the data, I am presenting should only be used to try to understand what we find this for additions of the course, where the sign and taught by myself while I was still in high school.I brought these contents to the teacher training team. When I become advisor, we design our brother, two ways course in with little digital content was only in the first part.The purpose of the course excited was providing teachers a view from the humanities, to the digital and discover what role, little religion has in the digital age, it is fair to say that there have been some other courses with a similar approach.Since 2020.As you see, this humanistic approach with or without digital literacy is practically insignificant in detail training online courses offered during the last year's.The question is, how do you make sense of the numbers, and the digital experiences that delay behind them.When I was looking for we blow Rafi for better understanding, I found that. Fortunately, there already studies on how digital data is received by study and guided by groups of experts and the complicity of teachers setter, as though those of the greatestgroup. And the ones of rigorous Anna Maria Machado and Albuquerque.These are the examples we have.On the other hand, I found that specially from 2018 studies done by university research groups on digital reading. Compare reading comprehension on screen, and on paper in young students.Glasses classrooms, occupy headlines in the place, telling parents and teachers that obviously reading on paper is much more significant, but none of these studies include digital.Professor john Elliott has developed, working with incorporates the dialogue between theory and practice at this hurt.The action research approach.It includes collaborative work between teachers of different levels, looking for building Siri, fromthis approach, which has never white been widely incorporated into schools becomes more alive in the light of digital literacy, and this is our content in our theory and practice should be very close.Practice should be very close. What I did was designed for the courses are visual classroom that emulated, they are working in path that I had experienced, assistant in the masters.Don't take the silence at it as goals to achieve. Now I realize that there were, were values that I wanted to put in the center of a group of teachers.Not everything in my goals was miserable achievement of those goals.But traced, a path of dialogue.Without the amenities in the way with that path is designed for for learning.It was organized in three lessons moving teachers from our general discussion about using technologies in the classroom to this specific digital literature content.And a final assignment essential for me to include was a group presentation with an emotional component. So that a feeling of being part of the group was be within articles is specialized and informative and discussing them in forums.Some examples, including digital activities done by me without forums to motivate the feeling of ability.If another teacher has done it, they can do it to turn on language set in a forum, leaving and enter in the classroom with new content to share.Within electronically Twitter, and sharing the experience in forums.And it was compulsory to assign an assignment related digital tools, and literature, feedback and assessment were shared in the follow as an opportunity to for improvement, and rewriting all completing the assignment.In that way the contents, things along the years, but not the Learning Path.As you can see in my additions phones prevailed. With the advisors team forums were held in the first path.Then, We're in the majority as a team decision.These have some the elite works, teachers, read some of them now lost in Catalan, including arena lesson translation, some English.open electronic Lisa was for me, the strongest point of the course.It is the world's at their own pace and commented on them in the forums where I could assist them if they if they needed or data review of an elite war with personnel negative feedback, some information from the details, reading and discussing electronicLita good guidance for future detection.Electronic Lita for my teachers. Isa has seen to find if you don't know where to set.It has a great surprise effect OpenStack perspectives on Lita that are unique, and not necessarily link to social media or to suggest connections with other novelists, and disciplines, puts into play the reading skills that teachers have taking them tothe limit of an extra effort of comprehension.Say sets in motion a process of teacher empathy for students as teachers feel like learners contains a lot of the tactic potentialities that teachers can see immediately highlights the aspect of digital creation and makes teachers want to know how tocreate brings back important questions that the teacher routine makes us forget to do or reflect on again, such as what is Lita always leaveus have some teachers comments after within elite works. I have more than, than 30 pages of forums comments and 164 reviews on digital literature works from teachers and 99% are positive.From my point of view, integrating the humanistic approach for digital literacy reading and understanding electronic literature in schools and high schools opens the possibility, as earlier to remarks of theorizing from the standpoint of action.In addition we contribute to building a conscious digital culture that can be appropriated integrated and therefore transform by teachers, and consequently later bye bye students.We also bring studying as teachers together.Being together is the first step for being capable to go for what into a classroom, and then go ahead with electronic literature creation, translation, and dissemination, opening up new spaces for reflection from practice.Having been generalize it, the opinion that reading on screen says up superficial action, even being sometimes qualified as arm fall in offering electronic Lisa to our teachers will return them to an earlier stage to this stage of relearning, how to readliterary works.Besides, two different engagements operating them while reading elite as hails notice.First, an intense and concentrated attention at different points, he pay attention.And second, a deep and sustained attention in more or less long and recurrent periods. And in depth for specially in trying, trying to understand the global sense of our work.The potential.Reading elite is a demanding cognitive exercise that values the traditional reading baggage of teachers. Meanwhile, details combine it with own screen reading strategies that they have learned in video games, social media, or web surfing.We didn't need to tell each other, is not is not perceived by details as a superficial reading one time they separate electronic later.On the contrary, they value it as a difficult exercise. We read in as that, as a strategy is strategy they use several times.electronically Twitter represents as well, our wheat field where didactic Sapir, very quickly, as these words can be used to as tools for different purposes like learning languages creation discussing the tie contents, and more.But the most important scene is that that reading experience affects positively.Teachers values and beliefs. But only two teachers out of the 87 that complete the courses tools digitally data for the final assignment.If they like electronic literature so much did they not there to propose it in class.I wonder what would happen in a course entirely designed for teaching digital literature for school teachers with reflection time pose rereading Shane scaffolding carefully, not starting from the Boyd, helping to climb back from our reading traditionto beat a little.I never thought that this content was too specific or expert to offer to teachers who did studied from six to 17 years old, because I was addicted to digital literacy is to preach us not to be cultivated in a wider range, along with artists and expertreset is as they potentially dressers is highly revolutionary in aspects related to reading, and others regarding cultures and languages, not mentioned in the ones about social beliefs and misunderstanding about really not screens dT dt dT dt lt todayin schools could perhaps, help, help us to redefine their relationship between no let an action in the academic in your words, intellectual modal reflection is the one which still shapes our educational system in the West.And what counts as research in the academic a pure activity of thought, which is school passionless and completely disinterest disinterested seeking through for its own sake, with no way to the practical advantage advantage for the seeker, or for anyoneelse.It is impossible for the knowledge, produced by this type of of reflection to make any direct link with the experience of those who want to effect change in the world.I live in the share.Thank you very much for this wonderful presentation, and now I will pass the word to my dear colleague, a fella Phillies from University of Santa Spain.Okay. So, thank you.Thank you, Pamela.What mess.Sorry.I cannot understand that make sense.Okay. Yeah.So thank you so much.And thank you to the organization for the heel jobnow.Okay, here we are.I don't know what.Okay, anyway.Okay, here we are.Okay.Good morning everyone. Good evening. My name is Angela Phillies, and I am a professor at the Faculty of Humanities in Toledo at University of Toronto.I teach the course named advanced research and innovation, apply to heritage in the master of historical heritage, andof course the yellow Manta where I teach elite teach also Spanish grammar and language in oral and written communication in the degree of humanities and heritage, from 2013, but first of these, I was teaching a difficulty of humanities in Alba, whereasI made my, my beloved colleague contestant who passed away last year.This is a tribute to her.We both lunch, it's the first edition of the master in digital humanities in university I guess the element in 2005, and also the first master in digital humanities in Spain.But our dreams were dust by some managers who saw no future in digital humanities.And that master's degree disappeared.Then I met load our US who directed my doctoral thesis, and then I move to live, where I can be.That useless stuff.And what I even held the fourth congress of digital humanities and team.During my teaching intellectual, I have reflected about the keychain ofcheese.In both aura and read on the text, and they'llthink we're having some transmission difficulties. And let's see if Angela might be able to, to continue.It looks like she lost her connection.This week to 10 up.Otherwise, I will proceed, and maybe she might move to another location to get a better signal.Think.This way, this way just a tiny bit. And then if killer cannot recognize. I will start and maybe she can proceed. Just after me as well.If you don't know project.I might see.Okay, I think, so let's not talk to lose this precious time that we have here, I might go ahead with my presentation, and maybe until I come, come to see it right after me, so on, so that we still have time later for for open in the forum for questions.So let me go ahead and try to share my screen to.Okay, socan you. Can you see the screen here. Yes, I think you can. So Well good morning, and my name is Pat less on Henry. I am a professor of Spanish at the in the department of languages and cultures, at the United States Naval Academy.The title of my presentation as you can see, elite new perspective for teaching and learning of foreign languages, especially Spanish In my case, and countries.So it was back in 2007, that they participated in this symposium, the future of electronic literature and event organized by the electronic literature organization, and the Maryland Institute for technology in the humanities.One of the main concepts of the event was to highlight the presence and relevance of international electronic literature, in an attempt to promote elite works in various languages other than English, an international been in office color presented worksin French Catalan Nordic languages. And they also highlighted the fact that electronic literature is a global movement.By that time, there were a considerable number of elite works in Spanish, which had not reach a wider audience. I had already published an article on the intruder by Natalie Portman, which took up a hothead was born has a short story length Rosa, andit remediated it into a net art work with him with a navigation system with a platform that simulated arcade games of the 80s.And so by that time, I thought I realized the potential that a lead could have to engage the students in the learning of Spanish language literature and culture bookings work was just the beginning.which have been emerging in the last decade. In the summer of 2007. There was an article on a premier while on the roster management right the first, the Wright brothers first flight by Columbia and writer Gutierrez, in these work, which resembles a hopscotchnow as you can see the, the design not Gutierrez takes us to the idiosyncrasies of a small town in Colombia.Did you think receive that mark the big gap between classes, the power of the church, the power of the, of the government. By this time, his students had already been introduced to her head was bought his his ideas on the reserve the right there the textby reading the garden of 14 path. And they had also been introduced to Julio cortices hopscotch Russia, and they could relate.All these ideas to to elite as well.So, electronic literature in Spanish and your perspective in the to the study of the cultures of the Spanish speaking world were finally came to fruition to fruition.In the year, 2017, and it was taught at the United States Naval Academy for Union for Spring semesters, it was a special topics course, the 400 level.And it's important to highlight that the United States Naval Academy is the undergraduate college of the United States Naval service. It prepares the students to become professional officers of competence characters and compassion in the US Navy and MarineCorps on each shipment. That's what we call the students at our institution, graduate from the United States Naval Academy, with a bachelor degree of science.After four years, when they are commissioners, and since in the Navy, or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps. They serve in the Navy, all over the world, with different Navy's or the Marine Corps for at least five years.So, electronic literature as this course, a for the, for the teaching of language.Spanish as a foreign language, and the cultures of the Spanish speaking world was also aligned with the mission, and the goals of the languages and cultures department to produce graduates who possess a fundamental understanding of foreign languages andsocieties, from linguistic literary, cultural, and geopolitical perspectives.So what what are the course calls to develop knowledge, skills and techniques ingredient and understanding challenging, electronic works in Spanish in various genres, to be able to express that knowledge in the form of essays on order presentations thatdemonstrated the students research skills, and language abilities to improve a student's proficiency in developing abstract ideas, analyzing literary evidence in Spanish to reflect on how the new digital tools, enhance the dissemination of historicaland cultural aspects of the Spanish speaking world.So who are the students. So the students were 80% of them come from the STEM majors, science, technology, engineering, and math. So you can see that there are ocean engineering naval architecture in robotics cyber operations, computer science, 20% ofthe students are in the humanities are reading the humanities and social sciences.For example, we call them Arabic is a major at the Naval Academy Chinese is a major Spanish is not a major English political science, history and economics.So their methodology follows a content based approach, without this regarding the inclusion of a competency based approach as suggested by some 2017. I think that we were both teaching elite in Spanish.At the same time, but with a different type of a students know. So I had to move forward to, to increase their linguistic skills, their cultural knowledge of the world.Now, and so the approach that some proposes emphasizes reading the literature as building designing touching on are listening.This course introduce relevant topics pertaining to the Spanish speaking world. We are elite works in Spanish and salmon English to be discussed in Spanish.This approach hello to the for the study of the Spanish as a foreign language and culture in an environment that was expected to is to improve the students linguistic skills, cultural knowledge, and digital literacy.So the challenges, the challenges were that reading elite in Spanish require a new understanding of literature, the text, the reader, an author, as well as new vocabulary to express those new concepts in a foreign language, his students became familiarand analyze elite in different forms hypermedia novels blog novels, poetry, tweeted at your net props gods, among others. This presentation does not include all the type of genres and activities that were included in that in those courses.Summer students develop a small elite project based on the knowledge they have from their science or humanities majors in that way they reflected on the new paradigms presented in the course, which call for reading as building and designing whenever possible.So, as the years went by, so there were more sources and resources for the students to do their research in Spanish, or in English and to have access to more material in the course started with two readings by you know the florists letter to the electronicallyand food to develop in our case letter to electronica, and as students from the very beginning were asked to work in pairs to pick a work from the electronic literature collection, and to present the main characteristics of these works to the class.We also had other sources of information and works like the center of your world Cervantes is also the MC, which provided valuable resources of elite works and critical essence.As the years went by, there were also more essays Bobbi Parish more critical work, publish publish in Spanish, and even a Catalina guides us a book, narrative is great because the title is in America Latina, it's an open source book.And the students, refer to it for their research as one more resources were coming up.The center of the center of the Buddha, the hotel in Mexico City, also provides a valuable source of elite works, and critical essays for the students and to do their, their risk.So, let's discuss some of the, of the works that were included in in some of the iterations of these of these courses, as I mentioned before, one of the first a pioneer works affiliate in Spanish is element while are there are some models right the firstflight of the Wright brothers by one we will theaters.These work hard different iterations, and it approximates the reader to the idiosyncrasies, as I mentioned before, of this model Colombian term. And these features can be very that will apply to many other small towns, all throughout Latin America andCentral America know, and that was also that a this feeling that a plane was arriving, and it was the advent of technology in a small town that face a feeling of incredulity among the inhabitants.So we discuss also the advent of the new technologies in our societies, the opinions that Latin Americans have about the, the advent of the new technologies are so we continued our syllabus with condition as extreme as the first elite science fictionin Spanish. Why was this this work chosen because one be able to rest takes us to a center for the but what that in this science fiction. What does he present he presents that a failure in a chemical plant due to a lack of security, it results in an accidentthat gave origin to a Milton Milton, Grace, so they are from these What do our students do with this. They read the language is very sophisticated in all these pieces, they increase their vocabulary, we discuss topics from pollution, the weight of themultinationals in Latin America, Central America Spain topics that can be easily be related to Latin America, and other parts of the world, not racism or so, what is also interesting is that can be able to rest developed in the last iteration of thisAlso, what is also interesting is that one big theorist developed in the last iteration of this work, what he calls leader at Ronnie.Ronnie adapted digital narrative system designed by mathematician and right there Home Depot theorists whereby the links have different destinations, depending on what the reader has with before.And we'll invite you to visit literature on IQ, to have an idea of how this program works very interesting.So, one of the works that really caught this students attention, and they really loved it is Gabrielle infinity infinity by a family Sandra Rodriguez who is from Columbia, an iconic, we can say almost a canonical all these pieces commission almost canonicalof the elite know, and worth of their preservation I think it takes us, the reader to the last half century in Columbia, 1949. During the time of the assassination of the leader, a Jorge Elysee their guide them done.And these gave him gave rise to a violent period called Love your lens Yeah. Since then onwards, Columbia has faced a period of violence throughout different decades, and under the confrontation at the time between liberals and conservatives.There is a lot of history. There's a lot of introduction to the society to the culture, way, we can see the connection between the US, the influence that US has in Latin America and Central America and they probably to Gabriella infinity reflects on theresonance of the US pop culture movements in Colombia. It brings the four topics like the Civil War, Gary awards repression, freedom of expression, fear and excited, and it also talks about all the movements from the 70s, the Vietnam War, the pop culture,how all those movements were affected in Colombia, at that time, it still has really a. As you can see from the image. It also deals with the power of womanhood.Now, we see a woman who is about to give birth in a chaotic boba know. So, and the baby probably as a single sign of hope for that, Columbia.We continue, then gold paragraph here, where the main character is a Mountie. This is a very sophisticated elite peace family hundred Rodriguez race has included, video games, three sets of video games parcels narratives, audio, and students really, whenthis was working before the exploration let's say your flesh that really engage in the video games to make sense of that plot to make sense of that story, we can see that the melody is in common, but he was a brutal.Priest embossed boss, which represent the dictators in in Latin America, not so that people who surround him almost to his last breath. We present all the voices were finally able to openly express the oppression that they have in viewer in tandem withthis elite piece of students do research on dictatorial regimes in Latin America, in migration from Spain to Latin America, there's a video game inside that takes the reader to Costa Rica.students being a future officers are made aware of the dangers and the treacherous rocky coast, which has caused many shipwrecks also not only the history but also the geography.Okay, as we move along we move to blogs, a must respect okay so to mother a very funny and very interesting blog that had a transition from blog to print to a very famous play in Argentina.So we talked about the idiosyncrasies of an Argentinian family, with a stallion ancestry. And so it portrays the economic crisis in Argentina in 2001.It also portrays reference to the Argentineans passion for soccer, the traditional drink which is the method. And also, we talk about little about publication, which is here the transition from the digital to the brain.And then to an iconic play.Then we'll move to Twitter at twitter to the students with about a serial chicken by God set of a set of data from Spain, and he did an experiment that lasted five days, the students read about it.And the main set cesspit in this one novel is a chicken. So the is the shape this, or it's that this is suspect, and hints were provided via Google Maps flicker Facebook, which allow the reader player to find out who was the real criminals.After reading this piece, the students discuss the possibilities of Twitter as a platform for writers and readers.Then we come to to Mexican elite pieces of Twitter to buy a main least your monthly figures, they might have tweeted is immersed in a society character is characterized by overpopulation.And the beauty of this presence of technology.So on that level here the M, the woman of fame represents a woman who is in solitude, who is a.the female hemisphere. No.Okay, so what came up of this reading of these introductions to Twitter to one of the English majors, who was a Spanish minor did his own little piece of Twitter too.So I had to erase a the names for privacy issues, but it was a fun way.He was very interested in this new way of expressing ideas and of expressing his creative writing.So, then we have a Tara extract CEO and a by Domenico Chappie in Dominica Chappie born in Peru lived in Venezuela now replicated in in Spain. So, this is a very rich piece, which takes us to Venezuela, to the exploitation to the first real of the oilto the first orange rail in Venezuela, in 1914. It's the exploitation of the people exploitation of the land. And these are the topics leads to them.The coming of age. Women who, after coming of age were sort of introduced to the white men who were being taken by, what are they added by the big oil companies not.And it also deals with topics related to Venezuela today. The big waves of immigration from Venezuela to Colombia, and to other parts of the world. This piece was very well received by the students, and they are all very difficult because they have alot of a culture, a lot but very challenging and the students really engaged in these discussions of elite and culture and language.So what that means total by Domenico chapter one of his latest species, also takes us to a it resembles a first shooter video game.And it takes the DVD player through the lyrics of the songs to the, to the awareness of what the authoritarian regimes, have been doing in Latin America it's very clear that the lyrics, since he was originally he lived in Venezuela, takes us back to theauthoritarian regime that is in place in Venezuela now. And it also brings a awareness about the role of social media and social platforms. So students, a talk about the different authoritarian regimes, and the role of social platforms in Latin America.Okay, this was one, this was a very fun activity, we did it twice with Dr Medina, with it cooking with anger Koskinen doc on the rabbi or not so we we work with the students from other universities, and he was organized by rock music, and Mark Medina.And this was a fun activity and were engaged with the students in produce, they produce a lot of written and oral language.It facilitated improvement of their language skills as they interacted with other students.And we have a sample here.So the challenge was that they this machine. Not that it gave us language in English, of course, the students didn't know all this vocabulary so they had to look it up, they had to see what it what it meant.And they have to create a narrative respond to other people, they could upload a sound, a file they could upload, they actually uploaded a video towards the towards the end, they created the final project of this, and you can see how the students areproducing a lot of language in Spanish, and they also communicated in English.So we did another one, one step forward two steps back. This was based on Twitter. So the students created their avatars, and this net profit was about being fit.And what different applications, would help us to be fit the students engaged in this and they really enjoyed.So then came in box, what do we do with box. And so the students, they have come across both, but they didn't know that both would also help us to learn about society protest.So we came up across.You know the florist protest details, which takes us to Puerto Rico and different cultural situations, and the abuse of women the government know. We also experienced, who can about the hurricane in Puerto Rico, and we were very lucky to have professor,united the floor is. He came to our institution to give a lecture, and he also gave a workshop at workshop to the students were a Dr. Flores, and the students created a preliminary version of that go ahead, which creates a speculative ideas manual topart of the Taco Bell's communitarian menu items.the corpus communitarian menu items. So this was very interesting for the students as well.So, towards the end of the semester we could then meet. Maria main CS narrative pointed narrative and vertical the less parents.It takes us is the relationship between Spain and Latin America is the rescue of 2200 refugees who go into. into France.After the Spanish Civil War to find refuge. By the end up in concentration camps, they are rescued by the Nobel Prize, Pablo Neruda who Commission's a ship, the Winnipeg, and takes all these people to Chile.So in this space as students do more research, they can see the names of all these people who have been joining virtually the barcode inexperienced people write the names of their family members, and those names are reflected as they are crossing theocean. So, it highlights the relevance of the winner the winner.So there's a lot of history, literature, language, and the students, of course, a look at the dynamics of this knowledge base and find out. Finally, the year was coming to an end.And there were final capstone projects to accomplish. So, some of them were motivating than others. And Sam, for example, ended up with a joint project.One of them was a, to, to expose a information about a lady for it. What a Muslim feminist an activist will disappear in 1980 during the watermelon Civil War.So I think that as the years go by Spanish elite in Spanish for the teaching of Spanish as a foreign language and culture has a lot of future, and us more and the anthology the Latin American anthology has come out and also the database from Chile, organizedby Catalina gangsta is up and running. So we are all delighted to have all these for a little sponge. Thank you very much.So, thank you.Thank you.I, I apologize for the inconvenience but my Wi Fi connection has fallen down so i i don't understand. I cannot understand that. Anyway, if you want a can follow with my presentation in the point.I lost my connection, if you want.So,well, what I was saying is that during my teaching in Toledo I have reflected about the teaching languages in both oral and written form, and about the hypertext, and the way the hypertext has transformed me, and they're below bit, our communication.I have concluded that they would teach, electronic text qualities, bad steel with a buttons of analog technologies with classical communications scheme.The one one, the one that Roman Jacobson designed in 1960 is blending the uni directional communication in the oral and writing environment.It looks like these, what I what I see is that our students know the scheme, but they use also the hypertext one even more than the other, in their daily communication.So I design a new review scheme that I propose in my thesis and dissertation, as around three journey among among sender message receiver.Let me continue with this quote of Dr. Philip Owlman, as you know.He was the creator of Benjamin the historical technical museum. And the research that they develop there in in in Benjamin there was not only crucial to the course of Second World War, but impacted in the future in this space travels and satellite links.And the way we are all connected right now. Even if I, I was out for him for a while.He said that the progress and innovation. The key aspect of modern society.And we, as a society, have an influence on what gets researched and developed. Therefore, we can affirm that the communicative change, we are facing has become a matter of research and development, not only in public communicative uses, but also in thosedefined as artistic like elite teaching in my courses.I has taught that the history of humanity is the history of the evolution of technique, our histories, also the history of teaching and learning the techniques and the technologies to capture and preserve their own story.The whole history.Moreover, every period of history has a new technology of writing that has had to be learned. So, we have the cave paintings. q&a form, writing your only fake writing appears scrolling Pranab law books printed books.And then, ebooks, I bought, iPad, Kindle or whatever.And they're standing understanding how these techniques work worked was critical to being among the light.Only those who had the knowledge, then had the power then.And the same thing is happening in the 21 century, with the use of ICT, and hypertext to our communication was Antonio medium, explain that idea when he says the struggle to understand and use the new digital technologies, requires many new things.Yes, but is it presupposes, the old ones. And the most important of these is really.So that's what I think.I mean, I think that we are facing a text well transition. We come from analog society where communication is linear sequential sequential, not only in, in, in reading, but also in writing.And now we are in front is digital society where telematics networks, and the generalization of the internet and the Hebrew text while language has these nonlinear non sequential communication.I'm, I'm trying to be very solid.So,I think we, we have a kind of context was sent in front of us with a text and elite.It's about hypertext while reading or electronic reading that give us a contextual sense of reading.That means that there is a text in total polymorphous in or a test, as the addition of each and every one of the elements that make up this appearance, which includes all verbal iconic and auditory forms, which are necessary each other to configure itsglobal meaning in the Muslim Allah who has constructed. These, these term poly accuracies from poly much numerous and a crisis, hearing action of listening.So, with the hypertext and lead. We are in front of a multiple listening listener, but I think there is also a multiple emission.I tried to create a these term Bali homely by analogy with polio crisis where Polly is also much numerous and homely is meeting conversation deal company.And I have.I want to return with this turn to the etymological sense of homely as idea of encounter meeting of Sander, including that virtual one.of participants. Maybe this is Neil, and Neil Agra or, and now our. The main characteristic is the immediacy and spontaneity of orange whiskers. Plus, the linguistic uses of written this course, united in this new digital and telling Matic space in thisspace, the role of sender and receiver has moved forward to that new paradigm.We have seen before.We are facing a new field of writing that multiplies, and this person has its dimensions.We can say that we are a we have a new communicative parody that affects the entire communicative process.And, as we see as, as we see, or as we know, we are right now.In the third horror ality and psychosis dexterity as Jose Manuel Louie Louie Louie MFES said them first orality is the norm morality. The second is mass media reality, and the third is the ICT orality.And then the second test when it is also the ICT just reality. And while the first week, was that with the manuscript and printed books were new digital born leader to emerge and respond to that new part of that body, we have new referential can on thatforces us to know the new reading paths.But research on elite is Dan using text. The first test reality that mean that that is manuscript, or printed. I, at least, mostly reading digital works continues to become paradoxically, and in most cases in plain sequential text.We teach third orality and second text quality, with the traditional methods of this second orality and first text reality.Our students can read as a polio crisis context wireless structure, but they use the bully homely just for personal communication, especially in social networks.By, but they don't use it for creating their own, he text, at least in my courses.I can show you some examples. I asked them to research about narrative.Digital narrative, or elite, and they do such works. You can see a momentous aspect of that it was yesterday goes from few analyse to the cause. That means, first or second first orality, and second text ality, you know, and also when they talk aboutvideo whales. They say that it bothers me the most as important as memory for American story and so on. But it's always writing, they don't create in these third orality and second text to ality.Even when they talk about high perfection.explorative, or constant.So, to conclude, non STEM students can read a text while instructor, Alia classes.But typically only homely is used for personal communication, not for creating their own, he text.So they know that technology as readers, not as writers.I think we are facing a new technology, and a new communication, communication padding.However, very few users are familiar with the coding technique of these new communications.So ix myself and I x. You are our students, digital natives us friends key says, in 2001, or simply digital consumers are they, digital residents us why to look on Lake on me, said, in 2011, or are they, therefore, digital litter litter eight, and thenshould we consider digital literate, to those who are just receivers, but not producers.Thank you very much, and I apologize again for the, for my presentation before. Thank you.Thank you. Thank you, Angela, and thank you everybody for being so patient, during our little things here and there but we have very few minutes for for questions if you would like to raise some questions comments.When you are thinking about some of the questions. I don't want to miss this opportunity to thank the organizers of this international 24 hour going on conference and we really appreciate this opportunity.Okay, thank you so much.Yes, Rob.Hello.Hi, wonderful presentations all of them and I just wanted to just follow up on the excellent point that Angela made in her conclusion about this compartmentalization or partition that I see in my students minds as well.Between all this incredible Creative Writing they do every day and literature with a capital L and, and, you know, can thinking of it like that. And I, I've been experimenting with ways to kind of bridge that gap.But it's, it is a really interesting problem and, and it's, it's just interesting to me to see.I try strategies like talking about the origins of the English novel, and how shaky they were and how nobody really knew if it was fiction or not or you know what and saying we're in a period like that.And sometimes that goes through that that sinks in, but what strategies are you using to kind of bridge that gap and say yes, this informal writing activity can become literature.Yes.Yeah. Are you the fruit yeah for all the panelists to.I think it gamed, it was very was very interesting to me when the English major, who was the Spanish minor decided to do the Twitter at your piece. She said, Oh, this is another way that I can express myself his story was about going from Mexico to theUnited States and get stranded in Mexico, and if he didn't know about these possibilities of being besides his paper journal know to to express his creative writing probably, and this was a new means for him to do that.So I think that was very interesting to for him to discover and for me to see, he was maybe in the fleet in the submarine or wherever he is now with the know he's whatever he's doing and communicating.For me, it was easier to do that with my teenager talent in the high school.Because when the point was that they, they don't think that that is later, when they go into the, into the Facebook or Twitter. And when I take them to the Twitter to Twitter to to speak, or to write about the additional Lita, they feel very sharp butat the, at the end, they like it very much with details, it was very hard, because they saw a when I began in 2015.Very few technology was into my region schools.And besides of that.It is a social discourse and telling all the time that social media is very full.And it's very difficult for the teachers to be there with their students. And it was hard during the, I think they 10 or 15 first hour so for my course.And that there has been not an education about that a database.But no, we saw a new monastic point of view, and a on screen tsunami, has come over us.You have so many tools, a teachers can do aka hood, or, I don't know, as crat.And we were not prepared for that.And, and now.Most of the details of that I know and some colleagues on in the teacher training center.They look all the these artifacts, some tools and and literature is not only a tool.But I think that that I'm agree with you, but I think also, the problem is our, I mean, of them, the teachers, the professor because sometimes we showed that tools as a game, and they don't understand that they are creating, but just plain, and also inin their homes. I mean, Whenstudents arrive at home and play with the computer on on their mobile phone or something. The parents think that they are just playing. So, you have to study, you don't have to play I mean, we have to change our mind.With that generation, I think because they are prepared to create in that.Or with this patterning, I think, but maybe we don'tlet them to think about this parenting, as a new paradigm, and a new paradigm to create I don't, I don't know if I,If I show you might my idea correctly, but sometimes is our problem, not only their problem.If they don't understand literature or elite as real literature is something that I hear from my students, but this is literature.Related her at the first time.I am a video game can be a real creation or.Because there is no taken on. I mean, We have a jihadi, for instance, and we can analyze that novel, but there's not a can on this.They don'tstudy the literature in high school. Like, they study literature.In the first or seconddegree, I don't know.So maybe, Maria. Hi. Hello.Hello. And I wanted to thank you for presentations, they were very inspiring. And I'm going to introduce some of your works and ideas in my course.And I wanted to add the just today. That's why I looked in a bit later at 230 I finished my class, and today it was the students presentation, they had to show their projects.So I think we are actually acting as bridges between the old paradigm, and the new paradigm, and as you said it I totally agree with you. It's also our responsibility.In this course, today I was fascinated because they completely outdid my expectations. I gave them ideas, suggestions, I showed them programs, but I have to confess, they did things.I don't even understand, I don't know how they manage, and this is students that they consist didn't know how to code, but they have their resources, so they tried to engage all the people from their surroundings to help them with their piece.Oh, you're a native speaker of English so you're going to record the audio for this story, all you know how to program help me with this, and I today we were, you know, summarizing, and I told them, You see, this is part of the process, this is, you know,an interdisciplinary field. You see, you need to ask for help, and all the problems you have overcome, you know like trying to, well, I couldn't integrate trying in these in WordPress but I did it this way.Well, this is part of, you know, our everyday circumstances, if you're a creator and you don't have all the skills you know so well I want to throw a bit of optimism, because I was, you know, really surprised happily surprised.And I think they felt proud, and that's something that, you know, I think the teachers are also offering them. Do something confront a challenge. And when you overcome.You know those problems you feel so powerful.That, I think, you know, for them. Also he was an interesting experience. So I think we're all part of this now, in every little field. We're trying to feel these passion, andGod.It's interesting for me because, you know, 20 years ago or not 2018, I guess, long time ago, when I first started teaching electronic literature in New Jersey.I would often get that reaction from students that, you know, how do I how do I read this I don't see this as literature, whereas now I think the stronger the more difficult pole, it's not it's not so much like they jump in and they can figure out interfacevery quickly and there's not that sort of blockage. But the bigger challenge is well how do you, what is this you know what is this literature. What is this reading you know what is this.I think it's more the sort of flipped more to the other direction.Yeah, exactly, or Mark says, what does it mean to interpret.So, in a way that's sort of a positive and negative. And then the other comment I was going to make just following up on what Maria was saying is one of the thing.One of the things that has struck me about, about the presentations here is how many.There's a lot of quite a few young people who are presenting video for the first time and not only that but who, who say, You know that it came out of their class, and like when we were interviewing below Muhammad, one of the authors that we interviewedfor the Copa de Lis documentary.It was really striking when he said, You know, I first started working on this coven project for my he lit class, you know it's it's just.I've been surprised at how many and pleasantly surprised at how many of the people here actually took a class on electronic literature, and often at places where I didn't even know that they were teaching it.So, so I'm really encouraged. Yeah.I optimist, I am optimistic too. And I my details were very very engaged, and I was worried because I didn't have more time to, to tell them.Okay, we will go ahead with the tools we we know we have, we know how to use, and now we all are doing.Electronic poem.So that's our summit to compare.I think I would like to thank again everybody I know we run almost out of time, and it's such a nice conversation we're having. Maybe we can continue it in one of the discourse or loans and could be nice to continue this.So by the Administration Administrator has his or her hand raised there, who I think, I think is telling us to move to the other track probably.So, I don't know. Is that so Scott, when the administrator raises his or her hand.We have to close the room is telling me, yes.Okay. Scott you're on mute.
