There's a jingle about to start playing.Oh.The meeting is also going to be recorded so if you're not comfortable with that, please turn off your videos and type your questions.Great, thank you.So hi everybody welcome to the last panel of the day, political and cultural issues in England number one.I'm going to be your moderator, I had to step in at the last moment, so please bear with me I actually have no moderating experience this is my first time.So yeah, but I'm, I'm very excited to get started.Um, so, I've already spoken to some of the presenters about this but screen sharing and presenting slides is fine I'm sure you're already familiar with those given all the panels you've been attending.Um, we would like you to limit your presentations to thank you for the support do.And the first up, if it's alright with everybody is going to be Leonardo FLOTUS who's going to present on digital colonialism, electronic literature as resistance.So, Leo when you're ready.All right, thank you very much. Let me set my timer and go.I'm sharing screen.Let's see share.Right, real quick I apologize I was over in track one the, the little, the little space was just really really thin and I just clicked on that so anyway I'm here.All right, so here we go i'm gonna i'm going to restart my timer cancel and start. Alright, so my talk digital colonialism, electronic literature as resistance here makes the following key claims, one that open and proprietary platforms such as programminglanguages the web Unicode flash iOS Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram or had your moment, historically privileging and centering the US and its allies and an uneven relationship to the rest of the world by creating the pendants on the platformsthey develop and profit from this is not one of the big ideas that I'm going to develop up and I'm going to touch on that in my talk right now.Open platforms like the web or programming languages are not less complicit than private commercial platforms in creating and perpetuating digital divides and colonialism digital colonialism and electronic literature generational frameworks expose someof the issues of digital access and digital colonialism. So let's unpack this.First of all, when we think about what conditions are necessary to have electronic literature, the creation of electronic literature arising from a population.One, you need access to digital devices and internet that came later in the generational framework.You need certain information and communication technology skills ICT skills, basic ones for example include benchmarks such as sending an email with an attachment standard ICT skills are things like creating a presentation, using presentation software,advanced.you're talking about programming.And finally, you need a certain level of privilege and and I'm thinking privilege at the level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs at which, at the top of the pyramid you have creativity, but you also have need the privilege of access to an audience to a communityto a field.Now this digital device when we think about access to computers in a historical sense, we know that computers were developed primarily by the military for code breaking World War Two, then by universities research labs and companies dedicated to thesekinds of electronics and and and machinery right and that all of these companies were originated in the US, England and Europe and then they had subsidiaries around the world, and then the subsidiary, there is obviously contribute.Most of these foundational technologies that are foundational I mean to everything we do in digital devices, such as programming languages ASCII Unicode, the World Wide Web Consortium, etc.are developed to this day by organizations and companies, primarily in the US, England, Europe, and its allies.When you look at the big picture historical of this digital device when it comes to internet access. right. So, so my earlier point is the US and Europe, and its allies, basically had first access to computers, they had a first crack at it.Then, Internet access, you can see how over time, this has developed and noticed, I will point out that the United North America is fez been fairly flat.It reached a pretty strong internet access penetration to its audience, whereas other countries, they have had remarkable growth but in more recent years, and they.So, so the US and Europe have had longest access to internet and and in a larger portion of its population.If you look at contemporary access to internet, and notice youth, there's a youth Mark defined this 15 to 24 year old individuals, right.Notice that the world has about 51%, access to internet 69% percent of us are using the internet, Africa, Arab states.You know you can see the divides right in the Americas, when you include Latin America, you know, in the North America Latin America, that kind of brings up below Europe, but if you think about the developed world or developing world, or the least developedcountries.You can see the real digital divide there in terms of access to internet.When it comes to skills, right what we can do in 40% of the countries, oh my god I ran out of time. Basically, these digital divide, really expand to skills, and I'm going to skip over this.But notice, I'll highlight the last bit here that only 15% of the countries of the world, have more than 10% of individuals who have written a computer program using a specialized programming language in the last three months.Okay.Digital Divide in terms of privilege, this isn't just at a global level, this happens along economic axes along gender axes.One of the reasons eel It is so white in the United States and Europe, is because of some of these, you know, privilege differences, people who are dealing with prejudice, with racism with with persecution with police brutality are less likely to be inthe spot where they can start getting creative and playing around with computers and creating alerts.So that's where that went. So we, when we think about it generations and access the first generation of evil it had, you know, whoever had access to mainframe and personal computers and had advanced ICT skills, and had enough privilege to be able to createthat right that that that trifecta. These were the people that did it and they are a low number.Second generation. With the increasing access to personal computers and the Internet, but also things like web hosting. Well also advanced ICP skills, and some offering software like flash that made things easier and more accessible.Then you have a greater number of creators of of the third generation though.We have much broader access to digital devices, Internet, and by digital devices. I'm going beyond the personal computer to include things like tablets and mobile devices.But we have a lot easier access to internet social media networks apps and platforms that are free to use.And they don't require advanced ICT skills. Standard ICP skills, using the software, and these intuitive platform is enough. And therefore, you have larger number of people, likely to produce electronic literature, concluding thoughts platforms that requirehigher ICT skills perpetuate digital divides platforms that require higher economic investment from the user perpetuate digital divides, and here I'm talking about something as simple as the web, who has the money to have their own server their own addresstheir own URL and pay that on a regular basis, not on the global, very few people at a global level technologies that require lower ICT skills and lower economic barriers, break digital divides.So, again, we may not like that certain platforms will give free internet access and keep people in a certain lock page, but at the same time they're getting access to help me colonize the field, what can we do one create publication venues for a litwith lower barriers to entry, and that recent initiative that resulted in filter and reverb are starting to help do that to create and promote platforms with lower barriers to entry.When you create something like twine that suddenly gets a whole bunch of people creating hypertext, and you have something that will host it with a Twitter account.You have lower barriers to entry, you have opened an important door, and making space for underrepresented voices and these voices are out there. we want to hear what they have to say.For more details, I recommend checking out a talk. I recently gave a lecture, called technological imperialism and digital writing in which I really unpack the imperialist aspects of some of these technologies and it's available in my website.Thank you.Okay so much, that was a really, really great if you could like the the paper that you just put up in the chat, I would personally be grateful and I think many people in the audience would be too.Um, we will save the questions for after all the presentations if that's all right with everybody.Next up is Devin shepherd who is going to present the art of the panopticon Farmville and the gamification of the digital landscape.Right, thank you very much. I'm very excited to be here and to follow Dr. Flores this talk, because I think I'll be touching on some of the similar things here so I'm going to share my screen instead of timer.Bear with me one second here.Right.Okay, so hopefully I can unpack that mouthful of a title a little bit better for you. So.Cast your minds back to 2009, when you were on facebook you almost undoubtedly encountered notifications about the game form built so I think what's important to remember about Farmville really dovetails well with what Dr.Flores was just saying.It really reduce the barrier of entry to a certain kind of digital experience.Not only that it really re cast what we think about how we really think about digital experiences. So, you know, at its at its peak Farm Bill had 32 million active users, and the profits that that resulted from this lower barrier of entry and meteoricrise of a user base helped to launch Facebook so it's important to remember that even though Farmville sort of considered maybe low culture or something that was a flash in the pan so to speak, no pun intended.We can still, we can still look at it really critically and learn some new things about it, I think, in retrospect so so that you're a kind of existed in 2009 to 2020.Basically, also, you know, wasn't Iran which flash was very on its way up but dominant and, and also made it possible to create things pretty easily.Another lower barrier there that we've lost access to. So, you know, in many ways, Farmville anticipated and inaugurated our current digital millionaire.So, so to speak, everything as a service the common word thrown around and it does. You know it circles has become really ubiquitous platforms within platforms is common.So if one platform dies, other things that are on it also die on the skills invested in those platforms die, or are much more difficult to archive or, or pass on.You know cloud computing. Big Data these things also allowed Farmville to be what it was. Those were sort of nascent at the time, and are just more, more or less, wallpaper at this point.So, Farmville is also free to play also common trope surveillance was also a big part of it and that wasn't abundantly clear to early adopters of this, this new world.So, those are all things to keep in the back of your mind, and I'll get more into this.And I'm going to check and make sure I can actually see my timer here okay yeah I'm halfway through. All right.So, obviously, appeal to a broad audience from bills themes were very low level they were, they were accessible, and it really made it possible for, you know, vast number of people to engage with it and understand it immediatelyFarmville also, you know, it dovetails really well with what critical theorists had talked about, you know, 50 years, beforehand.It's really just the perpetuation of of something that we've been seen for years where basically everything within kind of world of capitalism is eventually turned into more or less the same thing.And so even satires of games like Farmville become basically Farmville, a famous example Ian Burgos, the game scholar, created a game that was much like Farmville and gained much success in the same way because it was essentially the same thing.You can play a satire with a straight face and, and have the same result essentially.So it's, it's a bit like I think of this as a lobster trap you going forward you see the bait and you can't back out, it's you, you're basically forced to opt in, whether you want to up they're not you don't really know what you're getting yourself intohere in forecloses possible futures what we can actually imagine, once it takes hold.In this way, it's not so much viral as it is more cancerous. It gets into the system and we can't just rip it out without causing distress, interesting to think about that in terms of being in a global pandemic where we rely on these platforms enclosesour creative potential, what we can actually do is, is really reduce the the logic of a platform and variability is something that you know there's different words for the finality but you know infinite variability is very hard to sustain and once itcan't be sustained.The platform if it dies.So does its products in many cases so that's all to say that farm bills and interesting case study of where we are now.I think of this kind of ideology as an attempt to fill up all of our timer, our time and our attention. And that's how these things managed to remain profitable.If variability dies, so do the novelties of these games, casual and mobile games Farmville is sort of in that camp where nowadays we're playing things on our phone.It's sort of a resting spot so to speak. It's a temporary place to rest, but it also instrumental uses our time and energy, which in a simulation game, which Farmville also is is sort of also the trope.So I have this big chunk for my paper you can go and read that.But it's it's really at the end of the day about ownership, what do we actually have ownership over, do we control our own destiny in a digital sphere.And, you know, if, if we're to believe what Bernard Stiegler says about the digital as a farmer con. Is it just a matter of adjusting the dose, or is it something else and who gets to decide how much of it we should have at any given time.So yeah, that's my talk. Thank you for listening.Okay so much that was also great.Um, next up we have.Patrick Lickety. Did I pronounce your last name correctly.Patrick Are you there.Yes, I am. Okay, great, good i did i say your name correctly. Yeah lucky. Yeah.Yeah, let's put this way, a far better. I see, you know, People done far far worse with me.Oh,I'm presenting a paper called epidemiology and spatial narrative scaffolds into the pandemic confinement spaces and existential a narrative. And before you get started, I just wanted to plug your peace and our coven 19 exhibitions so if you haven't checkedout our exhibition websites, I invite you to Patrick's pieces there, alongside many other pieces that deal with the pandemic and the other themes of the conference so yes, I'll throw that in the fantastic I'll just get this started.Um, I'll tell you what the.Some of you may will find out in. In, basically coming hours or some. There's some announcements coming and it has taken a little bit of my time so basically what happens here is that what we have is kind of a mnemonic of my paper which will be up inabout the next three to four days, which has exploded into something about 4000 words which means that my work on spatial theory of spatial form has been expanding well so anyways what I'm looking at here is this a piece that I did in the UAE, about theexploration of my time in the, in the pandemic. And, you know, in the UAE from February to August of 2020 so for the past few years I've been working in the notion of virtual corporatism VR technology and Middle East narratives since I've been living.I'm now at Winona State but for the last five years I've been living in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.So, I'm basically confined spaces as such is a piece of a lead that deals with things in a spatial formal narrative, non textual structural and, but it's dealing with the space, what I call a sense of confinement.During the MRT lockdown. I'm, you know my key influences are just a frank and which I have been working in the idea of the collapse of time into a singular formal moment, and the notion of fragmentation of narrative.This is expanded over into, you know the work of WHHJT Mischel who took Frank, and basically started linking him to the idea of formal aesthetics.Greenberg, and so on and there are a lot of other scholars that you have expanded on this notion of spatial form and and for formal narratives, which I think is given the time being I have three minutes left, beyond the scope of this.So, my influences throughout time have been Coover red Berg Socolow Bob ministries, Caitlin Fisher and of course BP Nikolas seen here and Justin's Stevenson's film.The Complete Works.So, what happens is that what I've been interested in is works like like Redbird Coover and everybody's hearts and minds which basically takes Rick, you know, accounts of traumatic situations and placing them in kind of a spatial form breezes 3d p a 3dpoetry's that have also take, and compact poetry's onto it with a in a 3d form. And then, let's see here.And then Caitlin Fisher's Cartoon for the dead, which is kind of an agglomeration of, of, you know, of memory and madness. So, where I started out with this is that within about two or three weeks, my wife and I were in our apartment and.And basically, frustration of course starts going in and I started playing with different technologies to maybe try to break myself out of, you know, becoming madness.I started working with a program called display land which scanned the environment, not from a sense of, of the object, which is an inward, but an outward view and I'll get these fantastic videos now yeah here we go.And these are just beautiful things and I just be going around and just you know ad hoc doing these scans.And then I was thinking that you know, given my work in in spatial form I said, these have a narrative. These are amazing but the thing is is during my time, and I've got one minute.I worked from my neighborhood, I could only for the first two or three months I could only go within a kilometer of my of my apartment then next, this is the loop, Abu Dhabi, the scan of the, of the space.and the thing is is that we could go within Abu Dhabi the city's opened up within the within our state. And the thing is is that no tourists so you go to the loo and there's you know everybody's saying you're welcoming late you like family, which is verystrange, then third, this is actually not queen. This is one of the Northern Emirates.And the thing that was interesting to me was that I only had two days to go into the rest of the UAE once they opened up the once they opened up the actual state border, because I had to have a.I had to have a valid PCR tests, and they only had 48 hours I was have to get another one to get back in. So this is actually microwave up north, this is actually the plant a scan of the plane that was in the, in the, those supposedly in the movie Lordof War, which is basically just sitting out up in New York northern Emirates just waiting fall apart.And there are go cities and I went to the deer a clock tower.And there are go cities and I went to the dear of clocktower being that I am pretty much close to the end here what what I'm interested in here is that, as opposed to my other pieces which basically really went into the notional yo Fluxus and and Nicholsideas of of typographical Congress autism and that sort of thing I think that the way that the capturing did this is that it compromise the space to create kind of this, this spatial form in which I collapsed, this entire space of February, to Augustinto just a single existential moment that you're going through you're going from these spaces to spaces in this in this kind of flat fragmented way. And the one thing is, I'll just tell you from a technical perspective.None of this, that all this is done using 3d technology but none of it is delivered. Using 3d technology unity or unreal, or Web GL or anything like that that you know the people who are doing VR, and that sort of thing are doing.I Greg Can I can leave things open for discussion and by the way if you have an Oculus quest, you can fire this up and you can go through it in Oculus quest but I'll leave things open there for discussion.And then, big networks six minutes, and then, you know, I can answer more questions.Thank you so much. We're going to do to the discussion after the last presentation, which is happening now. Our last presentation is from Liam us, did I say your name correctly. Yep to set up correctly.Just going to stop the screen sharing what was happening.happening. And this paper is called American utopia analyzing the far right politics of bio shock infinite and Trump's America.Can everyone hear me.Good. All right, mR a timer quickly.So hi, Liam, I'm doing my paper on bio shock infinite.And, as we all lived through 2016 to 2020.There's the understanding that make America great again. And the messaging hit a chord with the majority of white Americans who believe that way influence.As soon as she declined, and therefore a direct threat to wait existence.However, this renewed energy I think reignited this utopian idea of America, one built on this delta of a more prominent and physical state of white supremacy.built to exclude anything that isn't on each organization conference at.So, one belt on this Soulja and more prominent visible states of white supremacy.So if anyone doesn't know what virus shocking, it is, is the 2013 first person shooter release, and you're taking place. The game takes place in the floating city of Columbia.It is a state that is built on the ideas of American exceptionalism American romanticism and utopianism, the player is sent to Columbia as Booker DeWitt an investigator who is tasked to find Elizabeth, as a means of wiping way down.Throughout the levels the player explores the segregated society as a violent uprising between Colombia's racial and economic classes begin to try to overturn the white ruling class.By using Columbia as a model, we can apply critical play to piece together and understand the context of how storytelling through gameplay can help the player better understand the realities of far right politics within the United States as Mary Flanaganstates in her essay critical computer games. Games are frameworks that designers can use to complex to model complex problems. In some cases, a game may provide the safest outlet available for exploring devastating conflicts.So by modeling this version of an American utopia. This we can distill and critically analyze what the far right in the United States are looking towards, and there are three ways that by our shop infinite does this really well.One, it shows it demonstrates the participation and the requirement of participation within white supremacy, to the state is reinforced usually through police violence and other military activity, and three the leaders of the state end up playing politics,like a game itself.Like our current reality, being on social media and Twitter. There are technologies that are in play within Colombian society as a whole.For example, box of phones, which are in game collectibles, that the player can collect are short form audio logs that detail, major character minor character and end PCs that exists within the society of Columbia.This is a chance for these characters to share internal thoughts, and what we see similar to how we see Trump supporters and other people at the far right, expressing thoughts on Twitter, Facebook and other digital media's.It's a way of taking internal thoughts and bringing them to the outside, but as a first person shooter, there is conflict and gameplay. And when the when it becomes active in terms of the gameplay, we see there.We see choice being presented towards the player in the form of the raffle square level, where the player is presented with a choice of throwing a baseball and beating up an interracial couple, the player has three choices.They can either throw the ball at the interracial couple, they can throw the ball at the antagonist who's the presenter of this raffle fair, or they can be passive and choose to not throw the ball at all.And depending on the choice, the player makes they're either rewarded for embracing white supremacy, bringing justice towards this couple, or they don't get any reward for being passive as well.From the perspective of the state police in Columbia, are used to suppress these ideologies against the resisting forces.For example, the Vox Populi, which is the main resistance towards the way upper class is often suppressed and we can do too, and we can find these details, through the environmental storytelling of you, the player just discovering audio.So for example, In this scene here.The two policemen are talking about new technology that is able to be used within Colombia, in order to reinforce and bring violence towardsthese rebels.And it's quite a mad, it's quite intense. Put that style. And it's this idea of law and order is at the beck and call of the seat in order to protect the state and to protect the underlying ideology.And this leads to the final kind of aspect of what buyer shock begins to sell as a story is that politics in itself is almost like a game. So, we have our leader here Comstock, and we have Trump in the United States.Using dividing conquer conquer techniques in order to push their idea of what utopia should be for the United States.At the end of the day, this simulation of America's greatness is mythology, in order to create an astrologer for a supremacist past that we know is wrong.is the underlying metaphor of exceptionalism that unravels, which this gameplay. If you play critically can help the player to understand the participant participatory nature of white supremacy.The act of the sea and violence by police and the act of politics as a game.So, we can see here, very similar things as to be not only aesthetic but also the rhetoric that we see within Photoshop, we see the blue Lives Matter, which aligns itself with the police, as well as far right organizations such as the crowd boys.And will the circle be unbroken.At this point I wrote this paper before the January six insurrection.So yeah, time will tell. And that is the gist of my paper. So thank you for listening.Great. Thank you so much, I mean the the actual content that at the end there was not great, but the work was great. Um, so now we have reached the discussion section, um, as the moderator there's something that I would like you to do just to help mekeep track, which is if you have a question to put you in the chat, and I will keep.I will keep myself engaged with the queue. I wanted a verb there.We would like the panelists to engage with each other first so if the panelists have questions for each other, please go ahead and I mean Patrick, you can just, you can go anywhere.How about Leonardo I thought, Leo I thought, sorry, as Leo I thought your, I thought yours was really good, but I think the one thing that I would love to do is that, I'd love to get into this a little bit more in a little bit more granularity becauseof the fact that I'm, I'm a, I'm a tech, I'm kind of a technic technology historian for, you know, mass media and that sort of thing. So the thing is is that it's really, it's really true that you know companies etc But no, really, I kind of get intothe notion that the early internet was, you know, really primarily, you know, academic and and military, you know until you know about the 80s 80s 90s and the one thing I think that you really frame this really well in that.I once did a piece in Karachi calling it was an installation called drawing the crunchy internet so what happened is, is that I was engaging with the people in in Karachi, Pakistan and we had a conversation about what would the internet be like to haveit was created in F It started in Karachi, and that was a fantastic conversation that you know tried to dissenter, you know this this this sort of, you know, dialogue between, you know between, you know, Anglo and and Colombian hedge hedge Geminis ofAmericas and the you know the the all the Imperial stuff for last 500 years nice for the thing, and, you know, is that. Yeah, I think it's really interesting to consider how we can you know how we can, you know, envision a decolonization of, of, of net netNET NET technologies, you know, and the only other thing I can say is that, you know how we can maybe start with that even though the, they're coming from the United States are things like Raspberry Pi's and such you know that you know, just like a Linuxcomputer that's under $50 that you know you could get get running and at least get into get into computation that could possibly dissenter from things like Macintosh and all this.Yeah, well you know, I will say, the US and analyze really got a good solid 20 year head start on the rest of the world in the in the developing of, of these technologies and and and even then the development of organizations like the ELO is just a littleover 20 years old. Right. And there are some older organizations hyper tags and those ACM. But, but basically, notice also American, European organizations, now we're starting to get leaked a lot and others coming up the surface.Now, when it comes to things like the Raspberry Pi.Here's the technology that's low cost, so that lowers the barrier to economic the economic barrier, but it raises the technical barrier.Right. And so, maybe not a, it's gonna it's coming. It's getting less well, not so much. I mean, the thing is is that you know you've got you've got open source software, you know like, like Open Office you've got GIMP you've got Blender you've got a,you know, a lot of stuff that doesn't require a liquor programming.You know, so I mean with a software in there does help for Yeah, so it's getting flatter.Yeah, well and and every effort that lowers the bar and flattens that learning curve. I'm all for it.Yeah, totally, totally, the one one other thing is as far as like you know centers of oppression, things like that, is that, I think, as well as, as well as economics and, you know, gender inequity and race and all that sort of thing is I'm also veryinterested in able ism and and neuro technicality, you know, to bring these things in there, because the thing is a lot I've done a lot of work in, in, in non visual VR.You know in spatial sound. And I think these are a lot of things we also need to bring to the table as well.Yeah, I agree with Alan Sondheim's comment that that there was this really kind of neat spot but of course who got to participate.I was, was also deeply divided in, you know, economic divides.Anyways, I'll, I'll. How about I piggyback a question to Devin, and it isn't so much a question it, you know after your talk. I went and just did a quick Google search for Farmville videos just that.And I got one point 37 million hits, just on that search right and and I, you know, to think of Farmville as as a platform that can be used for storytelling right and and i would imagine these videos are telling stories whether about how to, there's alot of that. But then there's also just people sharing right and it's just watching other people play has become a form of entertainment. And so, I'd love to.I mean, like, I'm fascinated by something as simple as as Farmville in terms of of its narrative potential Could you be talk a little bit about that. Sure yeah i mean i think i agree i think it's a wonderful almost like a gateway for some people theywere still playing it up to the end it was something they did, you know, I almost said religiously but that's actually something I touch on in my papers or of like, if you believe in something it's very helpful towards you know getting you into doingmore of it. Right, so not just reinforcing but creating beliefs in this system. So, whether that's good or bad I'm not really sure if that you know obviously someone creating a video, you know, creating content, you know we talked about content a lot.Regardless, it's sort of, at what point are you creating something that is like you were talking about your, your hierarchy of hierarchy of needs.That's something self actualization, and I guess for some people that might be different things depending on their own values what they feel is what they want to do.I mean, I really think it's it's short sighted to talk about things in terms of like low and high culture especially now when so many tools like Stiegler also talks about the proletariat carrion ization reducing access to tools.But what happens when those tools are, you know, given to you as like almost a rental. I think about like going into when we used to go into stores, if you were going to buy a expensive piece of electronics sometimes it would have like a cord attachedto it and you'd pull it and it would it would be attached and you couldn't remove it, you could kind of look at it but you always had to put it back before you know after you were done you never completely had control over your own agency you know withcreativity and I think, you know, something different with digital tools where it always has to be plugged into something for it to be functional.And so, when platforms go away or Farmville goes away we still have the material like the videos that people made I think that's great.You know I played as a kid I played Neopets and a lot of the games were based on flash but it also had a component where much of what you did was coding in HTML and you know it taught people so much and you know I didn't, I didn't get into that my paperbut there's definitely levels of it and I think they lead to different places, potentially, and I think I always believe in people's creativity to do.Pretty amazing things with very limited resources so I guess I'll leave it there.Okay, wonderful guys, um, if the panelists don't have any comments that they'd like to make to each other immediately, I will.Oh, you know what one, one more. I was just going back to maybe Liam and john is, what is it the.I was thinking of the idea of. I think this idea of resistance in fps games is really problematic but I was thinking of Rockstar Games title a state of emergency, as a, as kind of a as kind of a resistance simulator and I'm wondering what people thinkabout that I have, I have very mixed feelings about this I'm just wondering whether other people feel about that.Yeah, I, I said, I have similar agreements to you in terms of from like an anti violence perspective in terms of both the use of violence, kind of beginning violence as continual cycle which I think, spoiler alert on an almost 10 year game, kind of isof is at the heart of the whole plot twists within bio shock infinite is this complete kind of infinite cycle. And I think when it comes to a lot of First Person kind of near like narrative driven games that center around violence I think putting theplayer in that position can ultimately backfire in some situations, I think of the ideas of like gameplay for example withineven like the first iterations of bio shock where you are tasked to either save this little sister, which is this genetically engineered, little girl who produces like this biological material it's precious towards the society.You can either safer and get less of it, or you have to kill her.In order to get more of it and it's more advantageous in the short term. So, In terms of kind of going against it, I would tend to agree.Yeah, and actually bio shock I have a huge issue with it you know basically being being based off of random the first place, you know, it, it, it gives me the heebie jeebies sookay great so I will now move down in the queue. I'm sorry you had a question.Yes.I'm. I'm.And my question is to live but perhaps also to the panel.I'm very sympathetic to this idea of, you know, third generation and you know giving people access, and also for this community to actually you know listen to what happens outside of, you know, our field or in the broader culture, including being inclusive.But I also well you know I'm probably argue for sort of a dialectical approach because I think it's also a question of access to watch and and and and in a way of putting it would be to say, you know, if I, if I should be naughty on you and I know you'dlike, I can be a bit evil. I would say your argument, almost sounds like you know the the design guru, Don Norman, who sort of says that it is just a tool.We shouldn't let it be in the way of the task and you know that and and we should you know not let let the interface be a way of, you know, of the tour.So, and and and for me you know that would be, you know, we would become subservient to the software basically to the big software and.And in essence, you know.Yeah, It's a question of how do we how do we, you know, how do we get the greater outlook one not,you know, risk becoming the counter Farmville playing along with their politics or. Yeah.You know, I, I think I'm kind of saying the opposite, I'm saying they're all bad. I'm saying, like for example I remember once having a really fun conversation with with Ruth, who was talking about how Drupal is capitalism.Now, Drupal right free open source programming. Great. Right. But if anyone in this room has ever tried to have Drupal and host Drupal, you know that you need a small army of technical professionals that are going to do the upgrades because it breaksat a, you know, I think WordPress is much better than than, then, then Drupal, and even so it carries a lot of baggage within right so I'm not even talking about fancy tools right but the very fact that that to be able to have some of these free opensource systems. You have to fill capital, you literally have to throw money at the problem, or be at a high high high technical level.You know, you have to be a nick Monfort right Nick Monfort can afford to be free and open source, by the way, absolutely loving it Monfort right he and his work and the work he does and he works at MIT and he is his mission to share with the world isto rock a gorge is a platform. Right, that's a poem that's a, that's one of the first. He lit poetic poetic forms native, right. So, so I. So I think what he does and and had seen paper for example, free open source, everything with the MIT license.I'm one of the editors. I support this right, I'm, I'm putting my effort where my mouth is and I'm creating platforms that will make things a little easier for people to publish.Right. At the same time, I do recognize that, yes, we're giving access to the programming.But who has the knowledge to do programming, that's already a rarefied we've already cut out most of those pyramids. And we've already cut out the whole bunch of people in, in, in, in the digital divide.And so, what am I supporting if not something that maybe not at a sort of evil corporation data extraction level is exploiting people, but at a sort of weird or more distributed digital divide thing is still reinforcing.Shall I call it white supremacy.You know, it is it is have been conformed, learn to program in English, mostly or don't participate.So, they're all bad.All we can do all we can I mean, heck, what computer chips are made of is bad, you know like, or, or, all these components of my mobile, they're all bad.All we can do is help them better. Right. So, so I'm not saying some things are good and some things are bad.Maybe some things are worse, but in some ways if they give access.In some ways, they are better because they're getting participation.So, it's really complicated.We're screwed it's all bad.But, let's try to do good with this.And rant.Okay, let's move further down the queue, I'm Dina.Oh, Dina, would you like to say your question.Okay, we're gonna skip Dina for now, uh, Erica.Hi, so let me just find like a Christian, actually, which was.Yes, I know yeah it was also question for for Leo about whether this ideal you topic flattening or of of the availability and skill sets that we need for creating eat it doesn't involve some potential risk on the, on the other hand that it would actuallybe flattened out also for the, what we might consider as an elitist or salient kind of creativity, she look at social media that's one of the risks that seems a little bit.I don't know, abuse, perhaps, as a, as a risk that will give you the tools and it's easy to use, but you don't see perhaps that much of very inventing user it's perhaps also the specificity of these platforms that the more user friendly a tool is the,the less it allows perhaps for less space it allows for more imaginative or kind of directing hijacking kinds of fuses, I don't know, might be too pessimistic and approach but I don't know what everyone thinks and do in particular.Well, I'll say this and I'll connect a little bit with what we what Dana Larsen is mentioning in the chat.You know, where, in, in, in the developing world, and some of the least developed countries of the world, where digital technologies and internet access have, have been able to to penetrate is through mobile technologies, and, and, you know, and and thatmeans a real dependency on not being able to code on using apps and software that usually start with fairly limited features. Most things start simple, but then the features keep upgrading, you know the Instagram have now is not the Instagram that started.Tick tock, etc. So, so I'm interested in. Now here you have people who are expressing themselves in potential in artistic videography potentially literary ways because many of these apps allow you to insert writing into the products that you that youproduce, and I think that is the bridge to the literary.There should also be a certain artistic intent of the use of writing and language, but at the same time. Here you have people moving away from the page we're all still living under the shadow of the page.And, and generationally we're climbing out of that. And so, I think, access people creating. Listen, I'll take that.Let's say I mean people get bored with a simple features eventually they will move on to something better.And I think this is a massive. This is a massive digital skills incubator, and creativity incubator, and the stakes are so low to be able to produce something, you don't have to have as much.You don't have to be as high up on that mass lows pyramid of, of, of hierarchy of needs. So, It's access its numbers.Hey, I did I thought I'd take your point and God saved me from suggesting that I don't mean to Texas or anything like that. I was just wondering off the off the backside and indeed you say that the, the, the platforms also take up also what they see thatpeople are inventing and doing the with the, with the platforms. But ultimately, the problem is that obviously is the platforms that will be defining what's creative and what what they embrace and what they promote to the other users and they also thinkthe benefits from it so this might be the part of the cycle that wasn't so visible probably it was already there before the previous tools but wasn't so i would i would i would like to see something like filter into Instagram Xen, right, to start to defineand start to raise the bar and start to define what's cool and what's interesting at a literary level. And so this is us participating in these platforms.Good, thanks.I'm going to jump around in the queue a little bit in the interest of having more panelists participate so like to do you want to ask your question.Sure, and if you can hear some background noise, I'm in two panels that one so if at any point someone has said something serious and I randomly smiled, that is not need not taking you seriously.My question is for Liam and thank you for letting me have this, this way.Okay, so for Liam, would you like to talk a little bit more about speculative fictions as as forms of warning narratives and, and how they occur uniquely and the first person experiences the unfolding experiences of gameplay, especially as you mentionedlike being in a first person shooter game the effect of experiences so much more different and and then I'm when I'm referring to the warning narratives I'm thinking specifically of the rising genre of CLI phi which is climate fiction, which uses speculativefiction to show the extremes of where climate crisis will go so can we do that for political situations political dystopias what what might that look like.I think I accidentally asked two questions but the original one is game plan morning narratives.I think gameplay is a great way in order to combat these kinds of issues, specifically when it comes to speculative fiction I think most of the gameplay that if we look at like the 2010s is like, kind of like a decade of gameplay, there are a lot of exampleswhen it comes to speculative fiction, on pandemic even, like, The Last of Us for example is a great way of looking at what is the what is like the spread of pandemic.how does that affect not only our infrastructure in terms of, like the actual places we've lived and environments and interacting with those, but also the relationships that we have, and then we'll build once.The best way to put it shit hits the fan.In a sense, I think, bio shock, and it series as a whole is very much a speculative speculative series and it's in its own we see what the first iteration of bio shock in 2007, deal with this kind of laissez faire capitalism wrong, run a muck at the bottomof the sea, and we see in its subsequent sequels and even in its DLC content, we see the similar kind of approaches towardssocial cliques like a mock socialists kind of utopia with bio shock to as kind of a rejection of the first one, and we see with infinite this kind of evangelical very conservative far right approach to it.I think because of the immersive immersive nature of video games. It allows for, I think specular fiction to be. And like that john Ritter really kind of thrive.Because there's that interactivity, there's the Discover ability within it.That, I think it's just really really great at presenting. I hope that answers your question. Yeah and and actually I remember at the end of your talk, you were gesturing toward the fact that you'd written this part to the, to the, to the Congress occupation.I don't think that's the right word, because I'm pretty sure that replies activism which is not what that was. But I'm i would i would think that being having those circumstances, brought to the foreground, as as an unmediated before they happen, likewhen it happened I think a lot of people thought this isn't even real This doesn't feel like I'm watching real life. And so offering more of those circumstances I think is a little bit of what quantify does and I think could be much could be more effectiveand pushing that message and making people realize this is how it could be, if we're not careful. I don't want to take up speakers time though so that's real stuff.I think it. If I can also just add to, like, kind of the I think it also projects how it was or how it still is even in some cases, if we look at the mechanisms within bio shock and kind of the ideas of the state, aligning itself and the police forcefor example aligning itself with far right groups. we can see that within.Recent reports at least from the Canadian military for example where far right groups are an active participant or within military and there is a big problem in Canada with that at the moment.We see this in similar instances with police forces for example where you have ex military who have been radicalized either online or in person or wherever actively recruit members from police forces in order to form these militias.And we can see that happening in the past, even with other forms of media.Off the top of my head.I think I remember referencing in another paper. The use of like the Klu Klux Klan like the idea of white genocide is the birth of like within birth of the nation as a means of attracting to create these kinds of groups, and similar sentiment, you cansee within bio shock, but also other forms of gameplay and other video games for that matter.And I think that's what reinforces this idea of like speculative fiction, it's showing what could happen but it also is like really referencing what has happened and what is still happening in this in our current reality.Um, it's okay with everybody I want to sneak in with like a bridge question between Liam and Devon's presentations.So, W minute very interesting comment about how satire games like Farmville kind of fail is satire games because you end up playing them. Sincerely, in the same way that you would end up playing Farmville.And that made me think about while you were presenting lamb, about the extent to which bio shock actually does invite critical gameplay right because it seems as if like the project that cow quicker I think that you were talking about Devon like endsreally inviting that engaging gameplay, it goes right back into what you would expect the Farm Bill and I was, I was actually shocked, no pun intended, when I saw the visuals for bio shocked, they didn't look anything like I thought they would.And I've been living under a rock so I guess I've never seen a screenshot from bio shock. But, yeah, so I'm wondering what your guys's thoughts are on that.Um, do you want to go Firstly, am I had the privilege of reading Liam's paper and I'd like to hear his point of view on this first since there's a lot more to buy a shock than there is at least content wise, then there is the Farm Bill I'd say so.And, yeah, I think. Could you repeat the question just quickly, sorry I'm sorry I'm so long winded, um, yeah, I was just wondering to what extent biotech actually does invite the player to play it critically right because you mentioned like part of itsits appeal is critically engaged gameplay.But I'm wondering what resources are there in the game to encourage that.I think at least whenever whenever the company published the games that UK.I think whenever they first marketed the game they had some basis as to the story mode and what people were expecting of a bio shock franchise game. So in 2007 buyer shock, the original was critically acclaimed for storytelling and I think people go ingo in to buyer shock expecting story versus gameplay. It's not like a.It's not like a, like a call of duty, where the gameplay is refined by our shock infinite, and the barbershop series as a whole, I think, from a storytelling perspective, one is expected to have this critical engagement with its audience, and to withinthe game itself. There are so many different areas to not only explore but also to interact with in terms of and PCs, with their audio clippings, for example.So, a majority of my essay.And whenever I was replaying it to write this essay. A majority of these interactions happen immediately at the start of the game.And you aren't a lot of gun, you aren't allowed any weapons you aren't allowed any plasmids, and the first hour of the game is essentially a walkthrough of not only the lore and kind of feeling, but also what is the society about.So you can go up to NPC, they will say their bits, but also the aesthetic kind of realm of the game where you're seeing propaganda posters, we're seeing children interacting with other with other forms of propaganda.There are references back to popular media which is another, another tangent within the game and kind of how society is shaped and you only start to really get into conflict in terms of gameplay.After you make your first move and kind of your first active participation, either opposing white supremacy by stating that couple or favoring white supremacy by throwing the ball of the couple.So I think in terms of inviting people in order to critically thinking, in order to observe the environmental storytelling of the game.The first level and first aspects of bio shock, in order to not give you your weapons immediately.That kind of forces the player in order to really engage with what the text is saying to build on what Liam was saying, I hadn't played by a shock but I kind of at the same time was reading the newspaper, I ran into a recent book of criticism about thegames industry, which much of it focuses on the studio that's created by Osaka kind of set the precedent for this type of game. And a lot of these studios begin with this grand idea of, we want to make this you know oftentimes, I guess this author talksabout them in terms of immersive simulation so the genre is this open world game where you're asked to make all these decisions but, you know, for one thing, there's the meta narrative of the studio, they die because they can't consistently produce gameslike this that are really extremely.You know immersive they burn out a lot of the time. And then there's also the narrative of like, Who are you in the game like where are you in relation to the rest of this world, like you're not like some surf in a factory that never leaves and has tolike produce you know this like you're not in this decay, that can begin she in novel you know you're not like somebody who has a way to your agency, essentially your character as agency.So you're situated in a position where, like I believe the main character of bio shock and infinite is an ex Pinkerton so someone who is already sort of like implicated in this like power structure where there's people who are just below it and sort ofare faced and on in terms of speculative fiction like, you know, I just recently read a station 11 which is about you know pandemic pandemic global pandemic world ends, published in 2014 so contemporaneous with you know it's it's very prophetic in a way,but you know, in researching that it just one of the criticisms I read of specular fiction was that oftentimes it's, it's the disaster element is meant to effect a certain group.So, like, we was saying and, you know, we've touched on, like, it's always, you're always situated somehow in relationship in a political relationship with the content.And, you know, I don't think it affects it's safe to say it doesn't affect everyone in the same way. So, um, you know, in the sense of like environmental demise.To go back to what Dr. Finn was talking about earlier, like, you know, you have a very specific kind of person who is, or maybe even position in society that that that that reads books or engages with this type of literature, you know top of the hierarchyconcerns like they're the ones who are going to be sort of astonished and taken aback and then, you know, really it's like we don't want to become like the other that we're afraid of becoming like, essentially.So, yeah, it raises a lot of interesting questions and I think really bio shock and Farmville aren't that different in terms of the system that produces them and makes them valuable, the mechanisms are pretty much the same despite the content being quitedifferent. The choices being the choices we have employment quite different.One thing I think about is whether that what are the differences between like bow shock and Farmville but then on the other hand, is that I worked a bit with Ubisoft and there.And over Nava Dhabi and the thing is is their, their idea is that you know, the protagonist isn't the hero in the world is the hero, you know, in other words it's sort of like, you know, the your character isn't important.You know, it's it's the it's the world that's around and then the other things I also think of stories like Skype Room, you know, which are also open that have other, you know, other things so I'm just kind of wondering what the potentialities with thatare versus you know much more tightly scripted environments, you know like, like bio shock and, and even cow clicker which have very specific criteria to.Patrick's point, I think it's really interesting to think about what he presented on this sort of like going out into the actual world and capturing maybe I it looked like to me like photograph a tree where you're kind of like a yeah it was, yeah so you'reactually play land, and actually the last the last constraint on the whole thing is that when display land GOT GOT obsolete it on.And so I made 82, I have 82, you know, 3d models of all these terrains so forth and I use only 16 of them in in confinement spaces, and so the thing is is that this is a set of work.This is a set of material that I can work with, you know, probably for years but the issue is is that they're all object files and I've got video files and all that sort of thing but guess what I can't get anything like it ever again, which is reallyfasting.Yeah, just mentioned that because it seems like the production of that is totally different to the production of a video game at any skill, but definitely Farmville and bio shocker made by teams and to, you know, tons of technical expertise behind thata single auteur or something that's not usual to see in a in the sort of commercial world to reference what Dr. Flores said in the chat about, you know, we have, there's there's a framework for it, which also really reduces what it can potentially beat the end of the day.So, that's interesting. I guess to me.Just as a get just as a quick commentary is that confinement spaces has over 10,000 pieces of media in it.So and literally worked on it for I worked on it, solidly probably about three quarter, three quarter time each week for probably at least four to five months.So
