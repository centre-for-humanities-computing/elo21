Oh, I'm. Before you begin, I would like to first record it and then show you the jingle, and then I'll stop screen sharing and you can talk about it.Exactly.Okay, so can I start recording now.Yes. Yeah. Okay, thank you.Okay, so, um, I'm doing it again. So,my god.Yes, Michael, you can share the presentation, please because now he's recording.St.things.Well, Our presentation is neither archaeology, or genealogical approach to Peruvian electronic poetry and.Yes. So, this isan invitation that Michael and I do since two years ago.The.Because we realized that in our country, there is not much research on the matter, but there are interesting unnecessary work.And next Michael please.Okay, sorry there so thoroughly Empire three America trilogy means for us the possibility of understanding a history of poetry, from the influence and relationship of the works with our means of production.So, that is to change that traditional vision so worth one in which the environment can be defining criteria and not a forgotten on surprise, one for us is like Marshall McLuhan said the medium is the message.What you see is a single Metro halfway mass or five meters of points from night 1927. I work by the Peruvian poet Carlos Kendall and math printed bite me nervous is the on the on the right.From Casa godless who your sister, Maria you brothers. This printing machine is responsible for literally mother modernization in Peru.So it's too important for us to start with this. It's interesting that this printing company has print that or the descent, and abundance hard work, like this one, single McComas that refers to the media everywhere.Seeing it for it, try to emulate the cellulite of the cinema in a book format, which also has to be surely as personality and interior design movement.His work is important, because Carlos agenda, not only refers to a technological million. He also executives, it's in his work. So this is the beginning for us to our work from the media archaeology.Okay.So, this is what our classification has been both built around the medium and his characteristic.We have called this route from the mechanical muse, to the electronic news. So the llama some mechanical Alamosa electronica.So we have three pattern is identified by color intensity in our work. So at first you have words that use the computer in the, in the left. Okay, and decide that your jobs that have been created and pro and sold for the computer and also have been createda and do it for the computer on internet platforms, or on local platforms, so there is two ways from that word from the computer in the middle, you have the pattern that we call works that referred to cybernetics pre computer.So, here you have a the words that refer to cybernetics throughout the language can be informed on content.And on the right, you have the pattern words designed for nll media.These are words created, and sold for another of media that it can be in a printed on paper No.It means that can be do and paper from another local media or printed machine to see Dr. Michael, the next place.Okay, so did this vision from the media archaeology, which aims to show an aspect relegate to the poetic tradition for a Peruvian wedding tradition, a set the policy, community of constructing a genealogy, that understand that the history of this works.A is not linear, is a is different is intelligence.It also allow us to locate basis on patterns that the characteristic of work that use digital under relation with others experiment, experimentation, a prior to them.We can see that that Peruvian experimental boy tick works from before, to use a computer, or those made in another media breath sent elements that yellow with those that use these technologies.So, to establish this relationship with the pattern of the media archaeology and the genealogical, we have identified five common patterns. So Michael, can you open please.The presentation and moral.So, this is a first first aa tried to understand the genealogical a Peruvian media, so we have five.A common patterns that allow organization the following a missile ization effort this realization, in which this is to get them deliveries, our growth together.Now, neither geology and genealogy. And so, the first pattern we, we, we went to show you is Michael Can you is. Okay, this is the quality.I said, a circle of grass Yes. So, in this partner, are the works that use be Sweetie, in the space, either on the blank sheet or on that computer interface now so there is what the nice well It also allows them to highlight a condition of movement, soimportant for the first avant garde experiments.Okay, there's a lot of works that are influenced by an experimental of avant garde. If we could call them works that explore this like poetry. The other the other name to recognize these words can be also be shy boy.So, an example of this column of movement patterns that exist. it could be between career Solar Warden.And if you look, there is the, the pattern of this relative but also in in the space and laser and more your years later, there's another similar word from Michael Yotel who is also here, Michael Can you show the part where are your work, where thereis your work. Yes. So, if, if you can see their mental Carla so when Baldwin is has a similar similar patterns, or, or the work of Michael have similar patterns that hunger salute him.This word for my goal is a vocalist for beaten going oh boy Emma, but could be also by will win and everything by wisdom in a, in a point from Michael.So, in this pattern from Miss Wiley D. You also have a mic.But also there's a lot of books, Michael Can you open the, the, the presentation for because we went to see the others.So yes, Michael and I are not the only one. So you have a also in the visual pattern, you have cancer can go and Matt. Can you show the, the first migraine.See, is the murder four year scholarship endo and math. Okay, then. Next, a California Matt is from 1927.And then you got to have your solo good in 1977. And then you have.Michael if you want, you can move closer waterfrom the work, Rosa, or rose from 2006, then you have coziness your Lopez. That is a, is a rescue from, from a migraine that he rescued this work for mlm house.See,Maybe you, you are showing my presentation for themselves.Okay, just one person's account list, and then you you have Michael.Okay. A. Also, you have a Enrique bail metaverse was initially did this is a work that is made him with an earlier them into. No, I don't remember how you set it up into English my good reality.Reality Augmented augmented reality, augmented reality, this, This word is a real mental mental reality. A. You can play this with your cell phone. So you find bombs in, you can find points in the reality where there is a sort of a sudden video.Okay thanks Mike, please return to the personalization.So, that was the first butter, we, we can identify, then we got the stick of butter in this is the allergy.And that is the media. Okay, this, this partner shows that works that in their construction show an awareness of means of production of stand up.This means that they are there are points or are this with works in which the media needs, use of part of their meaning know it.For example, this is the media and so you have there.Again girls again the mat. It has to record Horace key, there is a Buddha Casa water beta Gloria humaneness Rafael Garcia was it Ambien and recover it and then also to and recover.So, an interesting example can be a, the one carried out by forgetful Roski and night.1964, with a nickel and can meet.with a computer. And that same operation with code ASCII I'm Boudicca is carried out or was the same or similar operation, it is carried out by Berra and girlish humans with the work that his name in English is not the naming a Spanish modify printingAnd, 2020, and 80, and 89, in which they modified a matrix printer to print, but this.OK, so the the top butter.Is that a scenario he knows.If you can see my going to charity. Yes. So, In this pattern.Here are the words that privilege, the sound dimension integration and use recording a programming or artificial intelligence for their Realization.This is a case of for example, in 1972, one go agent some and recorded on a tape callers a piece in which the names of the colors are harmonically repeat, Michael, as you can open the colors, maybe.Yo, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie.Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie yo.where are they.Where are they.Where are they.Very good.Okay.So cola for Nagel sunset and repeat a yellow, green, red and blue and different sounds.So, similar and work. It could be with programming, a barbell from my goal migrating you open barbell.So, in this work.My good, but my bed is, which is the some dimension appears when we interact with that interface. If you can interact manga.ma,saying, saying.So, Tom.Robin, Ma.Hey, go, Jim.Like Aaliyah ran, ran.Thanks, Mike.Thanks.So, in that part time. It's also, in other words, from our leftovers, that it's a word that it's and takes some parts of CT Hagen son is done with artificial intelligence, this, and Michael Can you open a presentation to see.So you have Michael.Yes and No it's not. It's the open the presentation is not.Okay. and you also have a national office. Okay. Well, the, the 45 mark.Thanks, East hypertext.The fourth pattern in hypertext, and here that highlight the words that are based on Lincoln's of data, or from quotes, or link.Okay. An example of this is quite a meaningful ways in via potato.This is analogous media is, is think until for the paper in 1978.I work in which the links between the birth are established by number.Yes. In the same way, militia for later in the last year.We just got four ladies here with us class at this our words oyster for us, a work related with collaborative in voice to text and hyperlinks.Okay, there's not a lot much time for me so I'm going to the fifth. the fifth pattern, please.I'm taking note of the fifth pattern, thanks for better. These are words that use mathematical operations to from the same elements points create other basic forms, see the permutation and.An example of this is it with her for God willing, and some.An example of this is with Jorge guard Williamson, again, who in 1950 had a permutations in the poems. Variations around the glass of water, no. Oh, but yes yeah Nessun Dorma and bustle of the hour.If you make a migraine from my finished and done and bustle Yeah.You can see the permutation.In that point.So it says, it must be minus he doing the slaves now, and can be the glass of water in my hands and doing my legs.My, my hands in the glass of water, and my lips on you. The glass of water in my lips and doing my hand, my lips in my hands, and you on the glass of water.So, these are words that means fermentation. And there is a similar operation in 2006, with a rose. Also, the cassava, in this work.The word rose, or Lawson spaniel place with its vibration and Spanish. So, if you make up a ratio with rose, you, you can have. You can have a little work, and in Spanish is Rosa, or was it.No. That can means a flower the roast but also that touch, no roof or sad.Okay, so I'm going to finish here. So, as you can see, there's a lot of information that has not yet been up, but I want to rescue that possibility of having generating an order it.This is an energy, and also is important, in the sense of woman here.If you see all the presentation. There is a movement.And we did not intend to point a direct influence of the analytical help with the digital ones, but with the, with the one is a, identify the similar patterns that electronic and digital convert into realization in the initial experiments, so it's notinfluence is, it's the patterns that are present in all the program for a particular edition. So, next is going to continue my good, and we show you a map of the revision electronic and digital poetry, a data visualization, and also Michael will explainour work, because this MIT Media technology and genealogy is not a show in this is also to rescue and restore these pieces.We have called this transcoding water and scope. Because when we rest, we will. When we restaurant we also create a modified everything at work.And then finally, at meals.She's a researcher.And also, he's an artist and show us the last part of this genealogy, what young people in Peru is doing right now with digital poetry and electric electric poetry too.Thanks.Michael.Thanks.Okay, Sam Iwant to speak in Spanish, sorry.Okay.Okay.When a barista parte de la mesa.Boy you represented lays Rock Cafe, the illness plateaus Politico's esk.Where are you, Sarah Largo, the almost the stick with the manual,when they're finished it yesterday.Okay, a keynote Come in Sir, can master list areas can also throws Amazonia in Quantico.And at this point the customers thorough.A the poster material for the most are the most a category is a particular person material is alien, a software proprietary to a crazy suffer cat, no computer aided design.He said, I gotta react case, a redemption, especially context or Latin America, no.A entices me.Me Charla MacArthur, who's the mentor Sorel no context or Latin America knows you know the context of I wanna get some context to his distinctive were given contrast.In order for him block again category animals, no cinemas over as a strong interest in flesh, Jonas, just in weeks.He maintains his departure, they may or legitimately.A Giro party coming up into a while every Sarah.El Camino para facility was your authority on the business, the interplay he died, he died.But he didn't direct on the rest of illustrate the historically Say bye bye Denzel will be SS.

They can be no there see me eco why.Yeah, we have a mechanism which I had SS.Thanks, my God.Now we continue with me LucaLuca, I Young Artist some employed.Hi.Oh, no. One second.Okay.Hi, my name is minister phonetic is a Franca an art student specializing in painting of the quantity scenarios Agatha DiCaprio, and these opportunity I will talk about my thesis project in which I will explain the concept that I've been developing inthe name of the project is pulling that IP 232 dot 199 dot one dot one eight, and it's where I seek to create an electronic hyper textual poetry, visual and practice as an instrument of connection.So the topic is starts from the electronic literature and focus on social networks connectivity and interaction between the writer and the reader, as well as the interaction over poetry to recognize this poetry as well as as an action that tries to shapethe world, and creates during the process, nurturing the final product.So, for me, that has changed as a result of these new interactions on the internet. The approach and the means of communications as well.There are moments in which the relevance of disconnection brings us closer, when geography distance and time or space in us from each other. and then a question comes up.Why don't we believe in our visual reformatted and electronic poetry and allow us to connect through hyperlinks when bodies are not no longer there.I protect offers possibilities of keeping the community close, as well as directly, encouraging others to participate.The goal is to allow the other to reflect to be encouraged to create changes from the point to establish an interaction and connection between the writer and the reader.As I said before, and consolidate reconciling or treat as a method with skills to modify reality.Here are some concepts and keywords from which I start to make the interplay and send this as a process as a reflection, but also as a critique, to the activism.I got aor initiative of the reader to dive into the.The reinterpretation of the poetry from the image, as in the case of the hologram that's very seven cetera this reflection reflection convert on the languages, by which I wanted to develop the project, such as I believe web page video poetry.The project main resource of circulation is the Instagram account Belinda in which there will be points using the resources proposed by electronically transfer.Every one of the points will speak from a personal and community view where the participation of the other is always relevant.And the topics are extracted from the current situation such as Corbett pandemic context, and there is always the possibility of collaborative poetry.So, the file the process is kind of also the essence of the of my thesis and when in.In, when Instagram interactions are used the most. And one other external resources are utilized besides social networks, the artistic part of its process will have a link, whether acting to the website.So the blue circle in the deployments, as a wordplay among internet in ourselves and interdisciplinary.and as they are points that deal with their context with particular at that point, we read it as an as an action and interaction.So there are seven employments on the resources as I said before, now sharing material from users and my own creation, the Instagram stories and highlights stories are acts as a notification and also, as I said before file and.So the conclusion is that is that the intention of the process to be seen is for the constant inspection from others, and the interaction that occurs between them.So here the first employment is by month so I sorta. It was work with Google Drive application in a Word document.And here is to let the other Philly interact with the text, the option to come in and edit inside a file it's always available, and the general subject is the recent current time and virus, and there's a static pattern, the hyperlinks inside the boom,which weather access, either way to an image or a song, or maybe another point.The next one is in there by Matt for gold editor.And here comply videos which I personally saw as an avid. The point blends with the image and sounds equates around inside reflects a private share unveil.I asked the followers to share their own editor, which with a video or a photo. As a result, all their video.Cole, other additives was created the interaction here are the new are similar meanings. Now the other individuals decide to reveal the boys is enough that our peers are from some of my friends in order to generate less monotonous soI'm going to show some of these interviews in the end. And I just continue with the presentation and then I'm going to show you some of them.Okay, here in Alabama say so, as Mr. Boom boom The sound of the words, while being redone is what has the protectionism, the Sounders poetry's a new language that is created, I use as Mr as a sensory response, in which the person feel satisfaction listeningto the sounds.And again to make live, to make the sound less monotonous. I apply all their coats and language.Then it's a boy. Yet this seven processes the employment process of a form.It uses vj by editor for its interpretation and presentation.In a link.And if they come from procedure or poetry, you give them the machine variables and commands, and it responds, making the product.Okay. The word cyber boom in which words are gravitating in a spot.The instructions are not only in the Instagram post but also on the same page, assemble your point is the permanent suggestion to make the to make the drawing the curses is use the brush, brush creates a live in Mark, where the phrase, you are the point,point, which gives the user the possibility of being part of the action of the Interpol.Okay, in our, in our buildings.Here the link sprayed another language directly from communication from WhatsApp app, which are something like Telecom, for example, they are other links that are considered a strong ties in your social practices, where we can jump from one reality toanother. So images sounds awards. This one is blend between the virtual unsentimental, so there is no linear logic that allows us to perform only one way of portrayed a new conversation.Several.These are conversations, I asked three friends to make a short story in which we just play with words and images and songs, The difference between our kind of normal conversations are the words will be involvedhere some of the parts of the conversation again I will show some of these are at the end.Okay, dad is upset this in interpolate one nine.Um, it was on video arts animation stop motion. So it started with a conversation with the follower about the object that they are the best friends.And I asked them to take a photo of the object, and they kind of tell me the story behind it. And why is important. As a result of the conversation I create a point that also includes the keywords that they express the video.I'm sorry the posing questions following the video, and the process the result and, as well as the interaction is documented in the highlights stories.So,when I like kind of post these videos that I made. I also asked the followers, like what they think about the object that they have seen in that video.And, in which, like, they kind of react and make a choice of what is the object for them in order to make others assumptions and wait, kind of haikus from their answers.And this is also in the highlight stories.So finally, the last one is probably going to have five members of my family and friends to draw drawing on one with friends or something possible, and the other two something impossible.it may or not be.It may or not may not be related to the current situation. And on the other hand to write two sentences one related to your payment me life. And another during the pandemic, it didn't have to be related to your drawing.we face in Peru. Last November because of government. I also choose to ask for opinions in one sentence for that means for sensitive people, which is that age of means that, luckily my sister was an admin so as a mother how they felt on the marches thechanges and the injustice that arose.So I create a game in which the players Tuesday matches the pictures and connect them with the sentences that I have to create using only the words that they have written to me with family, friends and acquaintances.This edited vs are hidden in the images, such as we're here, here, and in this way is a kind of exclusive corpse that is created in which the boy is not only reading words, but in pictures, where a new random interplay was created every time they playedis kind of a performative act per se from the quality.It's proposed to connect you writer with experienced from the others as well.Also the results that are share are in the highlights stories.So here is like how it works.What I'm trying to generate with this interplay of myself feeling of belonging, on behalf of the user. And the tongue touching myself from the poem queda resistant to the situation that is handled from empathy and constant communication with the other.If the user does not generate any interaction points not complete, since their participation is expected to be part of the final product.The Creator for hypertext detaches himself from his own creation after providing the other with the path of spaces, through which the text is Director, director, but it's the reader for this is the path.So, as a tiny conclusion.I actually consider this project is an open door for interdisciplinary teams between new languages of poetry itself, as well as the different ways of creating images, it's an initiative for personal development in the visual effects, as well as for theothers will delve into these issues in the near future. The Belinda count exist to share and interact with viewers, and at the same time, extend what has been learned as an open dialogue, by tree has a universal meaning and it's necessary to joining notonly with those who were involved in the matter, but those who seek to understand themselves and their environment in a different way. Hopefully I will contribute to that course.So now, really, really quick.I want to show you some of these employments that are here. I don't know if you can see my page, I think you do. If not tell mescream. Sorry.So, this one is the one that Michael amber mill talked about,which you can click here and there's a hyperlink there were there were sown in this case.Then this one it's called a retired in.Let's see.
