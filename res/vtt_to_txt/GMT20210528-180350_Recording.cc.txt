I have not been able to see the game after the fact.It's to grow.But I'll do it for you.So, let's go.This story starts with an error in six hours on Saturday night in early September 2018 flames consumed the biggest collection of Brazilian historycourse I want to tell everything.But the question is, when is the appropriate time to release all the information.Only a handful of artifacts. The 20 million items that were housed in the museum survive this color so disaster.To give you a sense of perspective, the collection of the British Museum holds 8 million items.ella bottom me of the Brazilian memoryimage of a nation.It's lens.Its lens and its culture, the immense encyclopedic collection included priceless archives of pre Columbian indo American cultures.

So, let's give them a short round of applause.So who are we, I'm Kristin ass Wiley and I offered as Fox and we are cc Oh is that cheap corporeal officials at good movement, Inc. We're here to present our latest invention perfect movement engineering for better every day zooming, a little bit aboutus, we are amazing, and we are insightful and usually we're on a roll your bosses payroll.No seriously folks we love this this is our bread and butter with cheese and placed on a hot grill. We are the grilled cheese of this Zoo testing Brave New World, and happy to serve our Glee insights to Zoomers across the globe.We do this for upwards of $2,000 thousand dollars now. That's a lot.That's a day, we're generously donating our time to yellow. We're here to help you maximize your performances to level up or Zuma. So, before we begin, we need to get a little disclaimer, out of the way.So take a moment to read it, there's nothing unusual here just your typical terms and conditions.It continues So take a moment to scan it make sure everything is in order.Okay, here's the last bit go ahead and finish reading.Okay, great. So if you find our terms and conditions to be disagreeable. We invite you to leave the zoom call now hit the road jack, and if you stay, you are legally bound to our terms and conditions as being president this presentation confirms yourconsent.Okay, so everyone here can sense. Wonderful. Okay.So, here's an overview of our extensive qualitative and quantitative research based on observing our willing zoom clientele, and collecting their data.so after extensive review and analysis of our texts or test subjects data points. We found a positive correlation between better zoom performances and better workplace promotions and overall quality of life, and our expert data team has assured us thatthis research might not be perfect, but it's definitely good. So let's take a closer look at one of the data visualization, a deep dive. This is a rare behind the scenes look at where the magic happens.If you look at the upper right quadrant, you can easily see that our network data points establish a clear causal relationship between better zooming and better shoe money, we're all about the holistic human here at better movement ink.So, the first round, based on this extensive research we have identified three key realms of perfect movement based training. So, the first round the holistic situation of the entire body while teleconferencing.The second one is the micro movements of the face, including the man.The third is the realm of hand gestures which we know that you academics are particularly fond of.Okay, let's get into it. So we're going to need you are to turn on your cameras, Judy, would you mind, turning your camera on, Mark, would you mind also your camera because you might turn that on a en camera on please, a retro yeah please can you turnyour camera on Marjorie, we'd like to ask you to turn your camera on please okay anybody else, it doesn't have their camera on go ahead and flip that switch and turn that camera right ahead and turn that camera.People are scanning the screen and you want to make sure that your movements and expressions convey your best self. So, to set yourself up for success you need to make sure your zoom platform is on point.So, we'd like to invite you to click the arrow next to your video icon. Click Choose video filter, and then you'll see a range of options. For instance, if you are attending a Theodora hustle, it might make sense to use this stage filter.Most workplace contacts, you're probably want to keep it more professional so make sure to choose a filter that portrays you in your best light. We're particularly excited about the beta studio affects the zoom just rolled out, you'll find these by accessingthe blue link and the bottom right corner of the video filters pop up box.We've got browse, we've got lip color, just to make sure that if you're using these filters that you make sure that they are always on point.Now, what you've all been waiting for. We're going to demo three perfect movements. perfect movement, number one, the attempt, nod.So you're nodding thoughtfully. You're conveying attentiveness.And now let's break down these specific features that continuous nodding at an even tempo, not too fast, notjust.You're gonna want to slay me raise your eyebrows. Not too much you don't want to seem surprised, but wow, that was a really good idea and you really taken it in widened those eyes, but not too much, lean in, but not too far into slightly just to show.Meaning just slightly just to show. I'm really contemplating that while you're doing this, be careful to manage the micro movements and your eyebrows and your cheekbones, people will notice what's happening across your entire face.So once you've mastered the basics of this gesture, we have some optional advanced add on features for instance, chin on hand, you might lean forward.Hmm, and then keep nodding because how you're really thinking, or the hush your cell phone up Jessica to show you're really listening.So perfect movement. Number two, the empathetic furrow, you're concerned, but you're showing empathy. Now let's break down the specific features. So, the furrowed brow.The furrowed eyebrows soft eyes but not too soft. You don't want to look like you're asleep. Slightly flared nostrils to really show how much you're empathizing and a frown, an empathetic from though not a clown fromperfect movement number three, the million miles smile. You're leaving the meeting, you're giving your best outros smile and wave. You're conveying genuine warmth and leaving them all with a winning million mile smile.Now let's break down the specific features.The term.Make sure to choose good so that big movie star smile, make sure to scrunch your eyes and lift your cheekbones to convey genuine warm.The speed and rhythm of the wave, not too fast, not slow just right just right.So the hands also need to be in a correct distance from the camera so not too far. Oh, hello, or not too close, just right.So now freeze Once you've done this for a couple of moments you've gotten in your smile on your way you've made sure everyone has seen it while you're trying to find the button to leave the call.You're going to pause your wave and just freeze, while you find the clothes buttons you make sure to leave them with the best image.Okay, great. So now you're all going to get together and breakout rooms to practice in small groups you'll coach and support each other, to maximize your effective performance for each perfect movement.Once you've helped each other level up, and you've all reached optimal levels for one of the three movements, you will take a screenshot.So, you should, in effect, have three screenshots within five minutes, one document in each of the three perfect movements, you're going to want to designate one person within your small group to take each screenshot and upload it to a folder that weare posting in the chat now.So make sure that you click the link in the chat now to access the folder. This will provide evidence for your employers that you have successfully completed the perfect movement training.All right everyone has the link.All right folks, it's time to level up let's zoom off as we like to in five.So john. Are you having trouble joining your breakout room.Hey, welcome back everybody.So we'd like to practice the three movements, all together one more time, starting with perfect movement, number one, the attentive nod. Let's all do it together.And now perfect movement number two the empathetic furrow.And finally perfect movement number three, the million mile smile.Everybody you have successfully achieved.So we have a little something special for you. Just a little something that we're going to post in the chat now.So this is a certificate of completion, to give to your employer, showing that you have successfully leveled up in your workplace performance, we've dropped it in the chat and, and we've already signed it so we've left a blank space for you to fill inyour own name. Yes. So, this is just an introductory training to get your feet wet and our intensive training, you'll have the opportunity to really build up those face muscles and fully explore all three realms of perfect zoom movements, your certificatealso gives you a 5% discount on the more extended advanced training to reach your highest zoom potential to level up or zoom up as we like to say, so we're dropping our business cards in the chat, so you're able to contact us to schedule your follow upmore advanced training, so make sure to download our business cards as well as your completion certificate.

We have a brief award ceremony. And thanks to the organizers because this is the the the closing event please bear with us as we bring this this conference to an almost close remember there are panels afterthis. So, without further ado, let me introduce the awards. Now that yellow awards a few things that the community should know, they're all supported through donations for the award so these did not come from membership dues.They every year we select member of the board that will act as awards convener. This is a person that does not have any conflict of interest in terms of being eligible for an award that given year.That awards convener along with the board selects an external committee from the community to be the jury for the award, and the convener then works independently with the jury to, you know, we send out a call, but then the convener works independentlywith a jury to go through the process of selecting and awarding the yellow awards.The three yellow awards that we have come with $1,000 Prize, as well as a little plaque and board members who are eligible, the first year we were not eligible but then became eligible for awards as we externalize the process, because of the bylaws, boardmembers cannot receive any kind of funding.You know, we cannot accept funding. So, whenever, if any board member ever wins the award. That is assigned to usually a fellow fellow, that helps develop projects with the board member.And so these things are donated again.Without further ado, honor that I will introduce on an offer, who served as our awards convener and who's going to introduce the jury. And, and the awardees, so I'm all yours.Thank you, Leo let me share my screen so I can show you what it's going on with, with the awards this year.I hope you can see my screen.And,yeah, and here's the presentation so um yeah So indeed, I have a great pleasure and an honor to serve as, as the EO 2021, however it's convenient convener.And of course we have three categories, and I guess most of you are already familiar with, with the categories or other cooler words for a work of electronic richer the mkH inhales a word for for criticism of electronic literature and the merger easylucid dream Career Achievement Award.And, and the new category is coming, and it's going to be announced in roughly 10 minutes.So I had a great pleasure to to to work with wonderful remembers. And this year jury for the Robert Scoble awards, where Jason lewis i mean i'm happy and current and on the team.And I would like to also emphasize the fact that that the number of nominated works. This year was on significant rise from last year last year was 28 works nominated this year.It was 49 nominated artworks so it speaks volumes about how our field is expanding. And here are shortlisted artworks.This is the first of the shortlisted ones and see already probably know that it is Diego Bonita big data, and other artwork that will surely set, and this year I asked for, for show the set, and one winner so you'll probably know that another shortlistedartwork is Jason Nelson's, the wonders of last trajectories. And here you can see the jury's justifications, and we're a bit of time constraints. So I'm going to read all the justifications, you will be able to read it for us have probably in Mark Marino'sannouncements that usually comes after the ceremony.So here we have extremely interesting artwork, and I strongly encourage you to check all of them.Not only the winner gets this artwork is coming from.I think, very interestingplaces and people, and I'm not sure actually if I pronounced the name Shang tune Tim and Maria raw Oliva.I know that you're here in the audience so please can you sanction 10 can you pronounce your name so we know how to do it properly tension.Thank you very much. Thank you. I love this artwork for a match I must say, and now I'm the last of the shortlist at once. Amazing artwork immersive experience by Stephanie Dinkins Secret Garden and old buildings will be in the chat I believe in a moment.So now,the great moment has come, we have the winner in the category of the best electronic retoucher artworks produced in 2020. And the winner is.Laser hook the vine and the fish.And here is the justification of the jury.And I think it's also interesting that this artwork is kind of falls into the category that's not often discussed just webcomics. This is interesting in itself.Another category is the M catching has a word for criticism of electronic literature and Judy this year.We're Erica Guzman, Ruby curry Sam and Mark Marino, and I'm deeply grateful to all the dream members for the excellent work.We've got 15 works nominated which is slightly slight decrease from the last year when the 17works, or nominated.And here again we have two honorable mentions first of which is video Flores cloud vehicles and the riddle for Martha and follow your lead allots.appreciated by them.Marisa Burnham break dance.

And nowand it is my absolutely great pleasure to announce that the winner in the category is Jessica Pressman bookish ness loving books in a digital age. Columbia University Press 2020.And in a moment I will ask all winners to say a few words of cons.And here is what Vereen have emphasized about the book.And also I'm sure that many people in the audience have already seen it, read it, or participated in a in a in a book launch.And finally the Marjorie see Lusa bring Career Achievement Awards.with the juryconsistent.Dr. Carpenter and Manuel Portela nine nominations as compared to five nominations last year.And here is one and then the winner.And the winner iscapable injure.And also, I guess you'll agree that it's well deserved.And so now I would like to ask the winners, if they are with us to say a few words.I think we'll start with the winner of the robots Cooper awards. I'm wondering if if life is here with us.Probably not. I cannot really seeall thefunctions here so I don't see who is saying yes or no.

Yes. Congratulations.Thank you. It's really fantastic. I'm, I'm very surprised really a great honor. I went to my first yellow conference in 2002.Yeah, 2002 in Los Angeles, which is where I met Caitlyn Fisher and Dana Larsen and Dini and various other people so that is a lifetime really isn't it so thank you.Thank you so much for being being with us and and re emphasize your long standing cooperation and all the contribution that that you brought in into activity of the organization, and it, this, this.I'm verdict also will be delivered by the one and only Mark Marino who's gonna send out the announcement.And one more, one yellow or tomorrow. this year. And this is a new category that we wants to introduce, and the category is the maverick.And do you all probably know who's gonna be over there with the maverick, and soon, and I'm going to pass to Scott red bird and Caitlin Fisher who tell a bit more about the origins of the category and about behind the scenes, so to speak, I'm Caitlin.Sure, are you there Scott. I'm here. Okay, it's a bit anticlimactic now screen sharing for a minute or, or not.Maybe you could start anyway.Yeah, so go ahead.Yeah, I'll start. Um, so last year about this time at ELO when we were at the week for David Lauren Baker, we a number of us had a discussion around the importance of recognizing the artists and scholars and amazing people.As part of the halo community who, who sometimes are not the people, most likely to be winning the other awards because they're on a crazy brilliant genius path all their own.And so out of that discussion came came the idea for a maverick award. You want to take it over. From there, Scott for bit. Sure, yeah and as as Caitlyn said we were gathered at awake for, for, Damon, learn Baker, who was who was somebody who kind ofworked outside of the the guidelines and was very difficult person to categorize and and while we were talking at that event.Talent suggested that there should be a maverick award, an award for for someone who took an unconventional path. Yeah, who really sort of colored outside of the lines.And, of course, Damon is part of this prize there's a tribute to Damon, which is a bottle of Sondra man Damon's favorite liquor.And the prize will be $500 in a bottle of the center man.But as we as we make this award for the first time.We're thinking of talent, who I think is a maverickto which we can provide future aspirations for for everyone in the electronic literature community.Those of you who know talent, know that he was a skateboarder in a punk rocker, and a chef, a sous chef and a chef at one of the, a great restaurant in San Francisco, before he became a web designer and started a perceptive con a web design company inSan Francisco, and while he was, he was a web designer and independent creator, he created a web journal called beehive.That was in the 1990s and early 2000s.One of the most important venues and adventurous venues for the publication of electronic literature. And then those of you who know his work.Of course know Lexi to perplex sia, which is one of the most canonical works of electronic literature, but you also know that, you know, talent who came out of a, an arts background I worked a bit at Cal Arts and was was friends with Kathy actor and certainlyinfluenced by and developed works in a variety of media.Throughout his career and continues to not trying to talk in the in the past tense about talent.But he he worked in film.He worked in Visual Arts he's, he's worked in electronic literature in many different varieties. He's worked. He worked on the LL board to always provide the yellow board with an alternative perspective, Robert Coover.I remember when he was talking about what he was trying to do or why he got into electronic literature to begin with and started teaching it was he said that he always wanted to encourage writers to work against the grain of the media, in which they wereoperating and talent is someone who has always worked against the brain, and always challenged the media, he did things like start the under Academy college.An alternative University.That did not a here, to, to the normal rules for instance that you, you would pay tuition or be graded, but instead you would have kind of imaginary University realized, where you would all create together.So I'm very happy to announce the first winner of the maverick award, and to read the designation, which will be an award given in the future as well.by the yellow.And of course it'll be donation supported I encourage you all to donate, I will after this event.So, the maverick is to be awarded annually to an independent spirit.A writer artist researcher programmer designer performer, or hybrid creator who does not adhere to a conventional path.But creates their own.And in so doing, makes a singular contribution to the field of electronic literature.And the winner, of course, is talent.Well, I just wanted to just on behalf of my brother.He lives at Maverick life.And he did and he does, and he did from when he was a little kid.You can imagine growing up in a house with him.Being a little kid, andhim and a neighbor starting a film company at like 14 years old, and they started a theater in the neighbor's house concession stand.Amazing movies, you know, stop action films all this stuff.And it just continued on from there. And for for me to be able to accept this on his behalf.You have to understand that he was an inspiration for me to go into art education as well.I know he would have loved to have been here to accept it.Sorry.It won't just serve as an encouragement warm.But it will serve as an acknowledgement of years of hard work, dedication of perseverance, that all that to finally be recognized for it.So I want to thank ELO for honoring him in this way.And thank you for understanding and encouraging his Maverick way.So thank you.All right, love, love you The Mamet's, love you, love you, Dennis and love talent.So, talent will be watching this this video momentarily. And we hope that he has many years of creation, ahead of him.But I think this moment of recognizing that electronic literature isn't just about those of us who, who choose a conventional path, but those of us who, who do things that no one would expect.That's how our field came about and telling them what I think is the person who personifies that most. So thank you to the yellow for deciding to give this award.And thank you to talent and also our hearts go out right now to the moment family.Talent is is going to is going through some difficult times right now, but he's, he's going to survive and his life's work is treasured and valued by all of us.So thanks so much.
