I will explore some of the main components contributed to the drawing tool.Let's get started.writing has always been a huge part of my life.I write about anything.They're not necessarily good, but it's a ritual that I dohave written scripts lurks homes fictions and nonfiction means.I wrote about a movies that I saw keep one that the weather and random words like this.For me, grant writing is a way to de stress.I remember the first time that I started writing was actually an incident.I had just turned nine or 10. And my parents took me and my best friend camping, to celebrate my birthday.We're not really that outdoorsy type or adventurous type.So that was very exciting for me.Just outside our campsite.There was a stream with lots of rocks on it.And of course, as kids.Yeah, my friend had to go jump on the rocks.There I wasexcited to go on my first adventure for the rocks was too slippery.And my shoes was wrong.So I fell into the water.I remember crying so hard and feeling so embarrassed that our whole family had to pack up and go home.To this day, my friends so made phone with me.Remembering that afternoon, I can still feel the disappointment in the car ride home,remember feeling embarrassed remorseful sad.So when I got home, I started writing.My dad had kept all my journals from when I was a kid,There in his storein a studies.Couple of years ago I started looking at those journals and realized that I used to draw pictures to replace some of the words that I that I didn't know how to write that was very interesting to me.I started theorizing about those writings I did back when I was a kid, And I even tried to create those texts,but they just like to play for this, the pureness, and then I Eunice.What a shame how when you grow up, you become so preoccupied with making sense of everything.My favorite book was Blitz by Maggie Nelson. Blue Bloods, what's a gift from a friend.This was also her favorite book,I remember the first time I picked it up. My friend Rubio was playing.Van Halen guitar.And after a couple pages.I felt a kind of closeness to Maggie, to be, and even to Eddie Van Halendays later.I've decided to translate book into Chinese.I've asked Ruby would be a reason for someone to like the color blue.Sure appliedblues, the easiest color to match.It's like black, she said.It's an absence of color, but a color.It's like being expressive.While not appear to be expressivedown there inside seen gun show.Fortunately song portion she signs me. Yes,sir. So I'm sure sure that safe enjoy each fora color blue emerged from the coziness of an atom spirit created when two people are connected emotionally and intellectually and are physically.This was the sentence I wrote on the first page of the notebook, where I translated now since bullets.But there are words that cannot be expressed with different languages.There are words that are not meant to be translated.There are wordsthat are not meant to be translated.There are words that are not meant to be translated.from that I have been using for the past six years.Was that its maximum capacity.I've struggled for the last couple months.And finally, last week I had to do a hard reset to wipe it storage.I had a lot of trouble transferring all the data to the cloud around to another device.To be perfectly honest, I haven't been writing for a while now.I worked at a small company from nine to seven.A lot of my time and my energy got consumed.Empty soda cans and dirty laundry started to pile up in my room.Like the image of a stereotypical programmer.I hunched over the desk, thinking about the time that I fell into the stream.More as you on this tool, the slower, it becomes.I think it is also exhausted.It probably wants to go back.where you just saw was a tutorial for speak pen.And I encourage you to try it out.Thank you so much for watching.Feel free to leave some comments.and also improvements to the tools.I'll see you in my channel next time.Thank you so much easier for that beautiful piece on,Mark, Mark, Simon clapping I think from everybody.That's such a wonderful instrument that text one sprint and beautiful performance on it.Except we have Eric SEPA with women to a costume.Eric, are you awesome.A nice one back at the bottom fairly bad.insincere protective simply the illusion flashes and reels are laughter impertinence was fine and spiteful blacks,pq train the most I body whose synergy.

So the type of sparkling water which was supposed to do something or neutralize effects that the plansDid anything for how easily don't get when put into term that number is given the right materials for the right equations.The time for movement, which through an innovation of one of the druids could now be reckoned on one of the agricultural grids was estimated on what he called the comedy type in later humor, you'll note as a color printer ink can be accumulated in morethan one way. This was not possible to do in the tapping later which constitutes maker to abandon the product and engage in the botanical analysis of herbal threads, the classification of the Lucknow tendencies of the trip this criminal.The idea that you could form a consistent stands by leaping off rocks was almost universally disputed yet for the author of the tablet later it was clear that the only evidence of criminality was an active inversion.It was clear that this was not the data undermining most of the critiques that repetitive. That is, it was not through eventful analysis but the reproduction of event which, for all the many parameters to keep constant would consistently create randomvariations. The hunch of the performance completely in the solvent, the preservation of pigments and liquid combination with not reverse but the same club then each defense and violence in the idea of the desolation of the now entirely obscured figurewas the case of continuity, the manicure of simmering spiral inflation syndrome, and the comedy tabulate a record in the most wretched of terms reprimanded for a more consistent result.Thank you. That was beautiful.It was it was a good tour of a cosmic prismatic engine.Thank you.clapping.Next on our on our list is Jason Nelson, with secret lives of a lockdown objects but unfortunately I think those secret lives may remain secret because I don't think he's here with us Jason Are you here under, under an assumed name, different name.I don't think so. SoI'm just hoping that you'll suddenly appear but I don't think so. So next up we will have a dar who just momentarily appeared DARPA trauma and company from St Petersburg, Russia, with freedom is freedom is freedom is freedom.This performances are authored by Daria with participants who are students of the Laboratory of media poetry went to one instructors Berg.And so I read their names, I practice reading and they probably won't be too bad. The other participants are all Sasha, and need a Christian Scalia serial killer, and a totally Pamela master copy over, Leon stroke of the on a picnic over Catarina reviewover in an associate trust, and the PErforM participants in this performance also include you member of the audience or fellow performer in this zoom event if you would like to participate Daria will explain how this will work, and we'll have a concludingportion of this piece in tomorrow's performance session.So Daria. And thank you, America for introduction.I'm excited to be here. And so I'm really going to invite all of you to take part in performance, right after this meeting.Well actually, I'm sure you're tired of sitting in front of the screen and want to take a walk and it will be the performance section first combined for the trees, and communication that the telegraph cap.Give me 30 seconds I will share dreams means to telegram chat with you, this is Chad. Yeah. Okay.So now, I'm enjoying it.And so as I mentioned, all the Laboratory of media boys.They also they are in the performance. And I also call this some of you know, take back to Thomas is called freedom is freedom. freedom is freedom.Very short conceptual poem by service. After several of the classes he reflected on freedom to, to, and when me and students came up with the theme of the performance.We discussed this creation, old. The being a young artist in contemporary rush.internationally can take in jail time, even for a simple report or social medium. So now we as artists mirror our intentions, against the degree of inner freedom.So, it was our officers deflection on the, on the feel of the performance.I'm looking forward to, to reflections and. Now, let me say a few words about how to go How do you happen to be the moderator. It's actually right in the chat, and predetermine what media should be used to answer theold tasks so we will remind you of Inception from conceptual art.In fact, I was actually in a sense of the follower.It was the creative freedom and those given condition. So, we will have various tasks and you will have direct major. And so you have very determined condition of I'ma go over this The format is to understand the mechanics of the multimedia like Chad,Really so tools for the nation, like location noises voice messages, photos and social media file.Girl part of the leverage full fledged and re capture the participants in communication.So the loss of their us are being formed rapidly right here. Now, before our eyes and our fingers.So my best idea is to research this process process, and I invite you to search for your own logos of artistic communication in chat ties into the platform at the greatest to do.And please, let me say a few words about performance together, Andrew.I will turn on my creativity demonstration.For now you have the pedigree chart.I'm sotired of start right after the finish of this meeting, and it will last about 40 minutes.

Yes. Unfortunately I see the question charter So, no, you should have.Tesla car, but it's very easy just your phone number and the phone has a reputation for example, it looks like to with with telegram that you can use something like Google Voice or another like sort of temporary number to create an account so it wouldn'tnecessarily have to be your phone number.There are some other options if you're if you'd like to receive that are reluctant to, to use the app with your own number.Great I had one other question for you, Tommy which is, if, if people are not available right now. If they're available, say, a little later, could they join the chat and how the instructions and do it a little bit later between today and tomorrow.Is that something that is possible.No, it's just you know at that time.Everyone, this resistance.
