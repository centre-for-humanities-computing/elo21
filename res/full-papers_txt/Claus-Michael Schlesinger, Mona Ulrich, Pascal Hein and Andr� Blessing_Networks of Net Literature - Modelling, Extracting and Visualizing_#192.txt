1Introduction:Hyperfictionitinerariesandnetworktopology
“Zeit für die Bombe” (Berkenheger 1997, “Time for the Bomb”) is a complex hyperfiction by
Susanne Berkenheger, where the reader follows Veronika and three other protagonists
throughthenarrativeevolvingaroundabombinasuitcase.Theworkisbuiltofalargenumber
of interlinked snippets. Snippets can lead to just one more snippet or they can lead to more
than one. The reader thus constructs the line of events by choosing where to go next when
presented with more than one option. Text snippets can have multiple incoming links and
multipleoutgoinglinks.Readingitinerariescanleadtocertainsnippetsmorethanonce.Thus,
each reading constructs a specific narrative through specific choices at these hypertextual
intersections. Any individual itinerary will likely lead to some intersection snippets more than
once, which gives the reader the possibility to explore the other paths ignored before. At the
sametime,thenumberofsnippetsislargeenoughthattheoverallstructureofthetextisrather
difficult to deduce from following more and different itineraries. The text adresses the reader
explicitly in several reflexive passages where a choice leads to a snippet that starts with a

2
comment of that choice or musings about the motivation of the reader. Passing by a specific
intersection several times during one itinerary through the text also reflects on the narrative
structure and the constructive function of the reader and their reading. It points out the
contingency of a certain choice. And with each different route a reader explores, they sketch

The textual and narrative structure of “Zeit für die Bombe” can be approached both from the
perspective of the itinerary experience and from the perspective of the overall structure that

and interpreting these networks of net works needs to take into account both perspectives
and not confuse the network topology data and visualization with a stable version of an
otherwise dynamic object.1 At the same time, the network structure of a literary text can

The surge of web archives and the need for analytics approaches in recent years have led to
the development of
frameworks that provide functions for the extraction of reference
information from WARC files, notably the Archives Unleashed Toolkit (Lin et al. 2017) and
LinkGate(EldakarandAlsabbagh2020).Bothframeworksextractreferenceinformationfrom
the WARC header. References that were not written into the WARC header at crawl time are
lost. Both frameworks provide functions for large scale analytics, where efficiency is a major
factor. For our research on net literature, we need detailed representations of reference
networks. In this scenario, best outcome, meaning the software catching all references that
exist in a WARC file, is more important than computing efficiency. Our software module
Warc2graph2 provides multiple methods for analyzing WARC header and payload data that
canbecombinedinordertoachievemostdetailedresults.Sincethisiscomputationallycostly,
Warc2graph is suitable for analyzing single site objects and small to medium web archives
(asopposedtoanalyzingverylargewebarchives).

2AnalysissupportwithWarc2graph
Warc2graph was developed for analysing literary objects published on the Web containing
references in HTML elements. The tool extracts information about
the resources and
referenceswithinaliteraryobject andbuildsanetworkgraphbasedonthat information. With
resources, we mean reference targets like images or a HTML page. We consider a network
graph to be useful for many (not all) analytical approaches, because the web as a medium

2.1Examples
The mainstream web is influenced by usability principles to better distribute information and
products. Good usability should prevent users from leaving when they get lost due to bad
design.(Nielson2012)Butthecreativeuseofthemediumdoesnotalwaysadheretousability

in the user, for example, when authors work with hidden links, wild redirects or confusing link
structures. Asaresult, it canbedifficult forresearcherstoget anoverviewof thesiteandthe
resourcesitcontains.

4
The page “please find me - finde mich bitte, ich warte schon so lange” (Kyon 1988) is the
centerpoint of the work “Kyon‘s Metapage” by the author Kyon. It contains 31 references to
resources, 29 of which are HTML documents. The references use the <area> HTML element
thatdefinesaclickableareaonthepagebyspecifyingcoordinates,shapeandsize.Bysetting
a target address using the href attribute, the <area> tag becomes a hyperlink. (W3C: 4.8.12)
With this method, invisible links can be set everywhere. In Kyon‘s Metapage, the links are
placed above the colored elements in the image. Hidden links can be a challenge for
researching a particular work. They can only be accounted for methodically by reading the
sourcecode,eithermanuallyorautomatically.Informationabouttheresourcesandreferences
within the work helps researchers to make sure all references have been discovered without
needingtoanalyzethesourcecodemanuallypagebypage.
Another example is the work “btong” from Michael Kaiser. (Kaiser 2001) It contains 211
interlinkedHTMLdocuments.ThenetworkstructureisshowninFigure2.Theworkhasclear
boundaries and contains only work- and domain-internal references and resources. The
HTML elements <a>, <frame>, and <img> were used to reference resources. All
image
resources (nodes) and image references (edges) have been removed from the graph data,
sincethefocushereisprimarilyontheHTMLdocuments.Asasresult,allnodesinthegraph
represent HTML documents and all edges represent references through <a> and <frame>
elements. In this graph the size of a node is determined by the number of its incoming
references (larger node size means more incoming references). The visualization was made
GephiusingtheYifanHu‘sProportionalalgorithm.(Hu2005)
The visualization reveals that there are central and peripheral resources. It can be seen that
there are documents with either incoming and outgoing references and documents with only
one incoming reference, which are located at
the graph. Only a few
documents have very many references and are shown as hubs located more to the center of
thenetwork.

A network visualization can open up alternative analytical approaches, e.g. to pinpoint the
resources that are referenced most often and analyze if and why they play a central role.
However, such an analysis cannot be adequately conducted without the rendered work on
which it is based. Additionally, from our experience it is useful to initially record which HTML
reference elements exist in the work and whether it is contains <frame>, <iframes> or other
elementswhichallownestedbrowsingcontexts.
the kind of reference. Some
The edges in our graph data contain information about

context is usually a single browser window or a browser tab. Within a browsing context, if a
linkisclicked,thewebpagewillchange.However,HTMLelementslike <frame>and <iframe>
can initiate additional browsing contexts - so called nested browsing contexts. (W3C: HTML
5.2:6) When working with a network visualization, it is helpful to be able to see in the graph
how many browsing contexts the work contains or spawns and which resources will be
displayed in which browsing context. The problem of nested browsing contexts is rather

6
complex. With the current version of our software module, browsing contexts are not
automatically represented by the graph, but can be identified through the reference type
represented by the edge attributes.3 If a work contained only references via the <a> element
andthetargetattributecontainsthedefaultvalue“_self”,allpagesstayinthesamebrowsing
context. The sequence structure of the pages could be read from the graph and it would be
easy to get an idea about the rendered work. The more (nested) browser contexts a work
consistsof,themoredifficultitistoreaditsgraphsimilartothework.
Thework“btong”includes390referencesbetweenHTMLdocumentsviathe <frame>element
and206viathe <a> element.Asmentionedabove,theworkcontains211HTMLdocuments,
which means that some documents belong to more than one browsing context. The network
visualizationisthereforecomplicatedtoread.Theworkinterpretedbythebrowsernowhelps
toexplainwhysomeresourcesarereferencedmuchmoreoftenthantherest.Theworktakes
place mainly on pages like the one shown in Figure 3. These pages can be characterized by
the fact that they are always referenced through <a> and contain five references using the
<frame> element, spawning multiple browsing contexts. In Figure 3, the different browsing
contexts are marked and numbered. Table 1 lists the HTML documents belonging to Figure
3andtheirin-andoutdegrees.TheHTMLdocumentcontainedinthebrowsingcontextonthe
right (ID F) is referenced 20 times, making it the second most referenced resource within the

meansthat theresourcesfornavigationaremoreinterconnectedandappearmoreimportant

2.2Summary
Network graph data and visualization assists research by providing an overview of the work
(How much resources are included in the work?) and its structure (How are resources
interlinked?Whatincomingandoutgoingreferencesdoesaparticularresourcehave?).

Warc2graph does not recognize all possible references. The system has limited outcomes if
references are constructed using complex JavaScript, Java or any proprietary binary format
like Shockwave or Flash. Before working with Warc2graph (or any WARC analyzer), it is
necessarytodefineexpectationstakingintoaccounttheanalyticalscopeofthesystem.
3Corpus
The literary objects on which we developed warc2graph are part of the collection Literature
on the Web at the German Literature Archive (DLA) in Marbach. The collection contains
archivedliterarynetobjectswithatotalofabout500sources.Theobjectshavebeenarchived
from 2008 to 2018.4 The archived sources are currently accessible on the platform Literatur-
im-Netz. (Deutsches Literaturarchiv: Literatur im Netz) Within the collection, works are
assigned to the categories literary blogs,
literature.
Classificationisbasedongenreorconceptualcharacteristics.Technicalcharacteristicsofthe
sources are not decisive for the classification, and yet the sources within a category often
share similar technical characteristics. The net literature works in the collection were created
between 1995 and 2011. The majority of the works are characterized by common features,
whichdonot necessarilydescribethegenreof net literature. Thewebsiteswereoftenwritten
by the authors themselves and are not based on prefabricated templates. The object
boundaries of
the works are usually clearly definable and the objects contain several
interlinkedHTMLdocuments.
The collection mandate of the German Literature Archive Marbach encompasses german
literature and contemporary documents of literary and cultural life from 1750 to the present.

technical forms and time periods, or has been discussed in the cultural sector. (Deutsches
Literaturarchiv:Auswahlkriterien)
The web objects are archived in WARC files. The file stores the resources requested and
recievedbythecrawlerorotherwebarchivingtools,aswellasthecontrolcommunicationsof
commonInternetprotocols.AWARCfileconsistsmainlyofrecordedrequestsandresponses,
sent by client and webserver, and metadata describing the contained resources. (IIPC: The
WARC Format) Each literary net object is stored in its own WARC file. The resources (e.g.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java Applets, image files) are in the payloads of the recorded
responsesfromthewebserver.
4.Modelling
Inordertovisualizethestructuralinformationasagraph,weneededtodefinewhichelements
are represented by nodes and by edges. We decided on a graph model where the nodes
represent the resources and the edges represent the HTML elements referring from one
resourcetoanother.

Figure 5: Illustration of thegraph model

We colloquially refer to Warc2graph's operation as link extraction, but what we actually do is
"reference extraction". Only few HTML elements that we extract are considered links. W3C
defines only the following elements as links: <a>, <link> and <area>. (W3C: 4.12) However,
they are considered links only if they contain the href attribute. (W3C: HTML 5.2:4.5) There
are other HTML elements that also include the href attribute or other attributes that can refer
to html files: <base>, <frame>, <object>, <applet>, <embed>, <meta>, <form>, <button>, <q>
and <blockquote>.SoitisnotsufficienttosearchonlyforHTMLelementsconsideredaslinks.

11
This bears the question: If we want to collect not only links, how should the selection of
elements be extended? It seems clear that the focus is on looking for references to HTML
files,butcanitbeastrictruletolookonlyforthosereferences?Notforourpurpose,because
links to image files, PHP files, etc. would be disregarded, e.g. <a href=“nice.img“>, <a
href=“index.php“>.ItisalsonotpossibletolookonlyforHTMLelementscontainingabsolute
andrelativeHTTPURLs.ReferencestoimagefilesorPHPfileswouldbeincluded,butalink
to a mail adress (<a href=“mailto:someone@example.org“>)would be excluded. Since we
cannot distinguish HTML elements with references to URLs by either the type of referenced

5Warc2graphfunctions
UsingthepythonpackageWarc2grapharchivedwebsitesstoredintheWARCformat canbe
analysed and modelled as network graphs. The package can be obtained from the Python
PackageIndex.Itprovidesapythonlibrarythatallowsaversatileandcustomizableusageas
wellasaneasytousecommandlineapplication.
Our tool reads the WARC file using the library warcio (Webrecorder Project) and accesses
metadata and stored resources to find references between resources implemented as HTML
tags.Tobuildthenetworkgraphallresources–e.g.HTML,CSS,orimagefiles–aremodelled
as nodes while all references between them are modelled as edges. The nodes are defined
usingtheoriginalabsoluteURLandthedirectededgescontaininformationaboutthetagthat
connecttheresources.
5.1Usage
The command line interface can be accessed using the warc2graph command. Additionally
the path to a WARC file must be passed as a parameter. The tool processes the WARC file
andoutputsthreefiles:onefilecontainingthedatafromthenetworkgraphstoredintheGEXF
(GEXF Working Group 2009) format which is based on XML, another file containing multiple
visualizations for a first impression of the extracted references and a JSON file containing
metadatadescribingtheanalysedobjectaswellastheprocessofcreatingthenetworkgraph
(date and time of the creation as well as all parameters used for running the program).
Metadataiscreatedautomaticallyandcanbesupplementedmanually.Ifmorethanonepath
to WARC files is passed to the program, extraction results will be merged and presented in
one graph. This functionality is provided because WARC files are not supposed to be bigger
than 1GB which sometimes leads to websites being archived in more than one file. (IIPC)

12
Additionally, links to web pages on the live web can be passed, allowing analysis of websites
ontheliveweb.
The library warc2graph for use in python environments or programs provides the principal
function create_model that needs a path to a WARC file as input. This function returns a
directed graph that is implemented with the open source library NetworkX. (Hagberg et al.
2008) This means that NetworkX can then be used for further computation, e.g. calculate
centralitymetricsortestforspecificpropertiessuchascircularity.
5.2Methodology
ModelingawebsiteasanetworkgraphusingWarc2graphisatwo-step-process.Thefunction
warc2graph.extract_links reads the WARC files and extracts all the references while the
function warc2graph.create_network uses the extracted data to create the directed graph.
Using the python library the two steps can be run automatically in the background using the
create_modelfunctionbutcanalsobecalledseparately.Inthiscasethedatacanbeexamined
andcusomizedaftereachstep.
To extract the references from the WARC file our tool iterates over all the entries in this file
using the warcio library. All the HTML files are then analysed using three different extraction
methods.

2.

1. The most basic approach reads out the metadata stored in the WARC file. Usually all
the outlinks found at crawling will be stored here. This method is quite robust and
performant but it lacks flexibility. Domains can be filtered, but what was not found in
the crawling process can also not be analysed now. To make matters worse storing
the outlinks is not defined as a requirement in the WARC specification. Quality and
scopethusdependsonthetoolsusedforcrawlingandarchiving.
In our second approach we analyse the HTML data using the python library
BeautifulSoup. (Richardson 2020) All tags contained in the HTML data can be found
and checked for references to other resources. References that are generated
procedurallybythebrowserusingJavaScriptwillnotberecognized.
In order to also evaluate JavaScript the HTML data is processed with the remote
controlled headless browser Selenium. (Selenium Project) Opening and controlling

listisbeingtransposedtoanetworkgraph.Thedataandmetadatastoredinthegraphcanbe

The software is built in a modular fashion, so those interested only in the extraction of
references can rely on the list of tuples returned by the extract_links function. In the same
manner, a graph compatible with the graphs created from WARC files can be constructed by
passingalistoftuplestothe create_networkfunction.
6.NextSteps
We have used Warc2graph successfully for an exploration into non-linear text structures and
non-linear narrative in specific works of net literature from the DLA corpus. In order to make
the approach more robust we hope to expand the scope of our tests to other web archive
corpora, do a more in-depth assessment of existing WARC analytics frameworks and better
define the specific function Warc2graph can fulfill
in web archive analytics workflows.
Furthermore, the transformation of WARC files into graph representations opens up archival
and research possibilities on a corpus level. We will explore the possibilities of such graph
representations for further analytical questions pertaining not only to references, but also to
the content of the elements or nodes of each object and of different aggregations up to the
level of large web archives. This approach also requires epistemological and aesthetic
reflections on graph representations and topologies of either dynamic works of net literature
andnon-specializedwebarchives.
