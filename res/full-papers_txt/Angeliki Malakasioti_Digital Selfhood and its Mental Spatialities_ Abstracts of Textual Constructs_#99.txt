ABSTRACT 

Digital Selfhood and its Mental Spatialities: 

Abstracts of Textual Constructs 

Early cyberspatial theories reflected on the qualities of computer mediated experience by 

introducing  aspects  of  immateriality,  incorporeality,  symbolism,  abstraction,  as  well  as 

exploring  the  mental,  perceptual,  and  psychological  dimensions  of  digital  experience 

itself.  Electronic  interactions  have  been  described  as  platonically  erotic,  transcendental, 

allegorical,  even  ecstatic  conditions,  that  still  seem  timely  and  compelling  nowadays, 

even since the pre-pandemic era. Human mind appeared as an inherent ingredient of the 

digital  phenomenon  since  its  birth.  On  the  other  side,  ideas  such  as  ‘body  amnesia’  or 

‘fleshworld’, emerged denoting the rigidity of the physical body to reach the other side of 

the screen. 

These  days,  the  superfluous,  excessive,  sometimes  obsessive  use  of  digital  technology, 

pervasive  software  as  well  as  the  internet  of  things  have  surpassed  the  Cartesian 

mind-body dualism and have given rise to novel hybrid approaches of our contemporary 

relation  to  technology.  Hybridity  has  created  space  for  intertextual  interpretations  of 

experience, that do not divide the notion of mind and body, but comment on the complex 

interactions  of  self  with  digital  culture,  through  numerous  differentiated  contexts, 

evolving  cyborg  ontologies,  alternate  bodies,  human-nonhuman  systems,  transformative 

personas, neuroarchaeological readings of cultural plasticity, all rendered through a daily 

mediated reality. 

The study attempts to look at this ever-present conundrum, through an architectural point 

of view, venturing a theoretical quest on digital spatiality. Digital experience has always 

been inseparable from the metaphoric use of spatial concepts. At the same time, textual 

space  constitutes  an  allegorical  or  symbolic  construction  with  its  own  architecture, 

ambience, and other characteristics. Space is not only relating to the strict conception of 

geometry, physics, or mathematics, but also to an anthropological reading of existence, a 

quality  that  is  often  elusive  and  immeasurable,  thus  it  helps  define  abstract, 

psychological,  experiential  phenomena,  or  in  other  words,  that,  which  is  in  fact 

indefinable.   

In  this  context,  self  takes  the  role  of  a  mental  dynamic,  while  space  is  interpreted  as  a 

metaphoric,  volatile  construction  whose  literary  aesthetics  emerge  from  digital  culture. 

The  idea  of  digital  experience  is  approached  though  a  series  of  textual-spatial  concepts 

and projects that reflect on the space that is constructed in the interstitial area between the 

digitally platformed self and the mediated environment. This exploration takes the form 

of creative writings, chatbot interviews, exercises of verbal configurations, visual poetics, 

interactive  game-poems  and  other  abstracts  of  writing  in  both  artistic  and  educational 

contexts.  The  overall  idea  of  the  digital  mind-body  interpretation  takes  the  form  of  a 

series of mental spatialities that comment on our contemporary way of being in the digital 

world.  In  architecture,  to  read  means  to  uniquely  understand  and  thoroughly  grasp  the 

phenomena of the surrounding environment - in this case, space is translated in an altered 

vocabulary  that  helps  us  understand  what  it  means  to  ‘read’  the  contemporary  self  in  a 

platformed culture. 

 

Introduction 

 

I am the space where I am. 

Noël Arnaud, L´état d´ébauche1 

 

Contemporary  digital  platforms  are  not  a  novel  phenomenon.  Technological  integration 

in many aspects of life has already been present since the onset of computers, gaming, or 

the  use  of  web.  Innovative  digital  systems,  smart  devices  and  applications, 

fast-developing  social  media  and  the  Internet-of-Things  have  already  formed  a  fertile 

1  Arnaud, Noël, L´état d´ébauche, Le Messager Boîteaux, Paris, 1950, as quoted in Bachelard, Gaston, The 
Poetics of Space, Orion Press, 1968, p.137 

 

ground for the platformization of everyday life. The ongoing pandemic though, has raised 

this  phenomenon  to  an  excessive  degree.  We  do  not  talk  nowadays  about  the 

platformization  of  services  or  activities,  but  rather  about  the  platformization  of 

experiences  and  culture.  Additionally,  all  connotations  of  the  ‘platform’  concept  have 

given 

rise 

to 

relative  discussions  around  notions  of 

‘staging’, 

‘proposing’, 

‘programming’,  ‘planning’,  or  ‘showcasing’.  To  set  a  platform  for  an  experience  to 

happen,  presupposes  the  adoption  of  a  common  language,  a  commonly  shared  acting 

consensus though which users may be expressed during their online presence or consume 

digital content in a specifically designed manner.   

An  important  question  arises  at  these  critical  times  of  the  pandemic  phenomenon.  If 

digital  platformization  of  multiple  aspects  of  life  is  more  relevant  than  ever  nowadays, 

then how are we to understand the ways in which ourselves are experienced through this 

constantly  mediated  condition?  And  how  can  this  form  the  onset  for  rethinking  the 

already  established  digital  norms  or  our  potential  future  online  presence(s)  which  lie(s) 

ahead?   

 

Spatial delineation 

 

As an  architect,  spatial  education has played  an important  role in the delineation of my 

selfhood  through  spatial  mechanisms.  Self  and  body  are  interlinked  through  multiple 

spatial correlations of definitions, metaphoric expressions or even personal practices that 

make  this  notional  diptych  a  fluctuating  ontological  model.  Digital  connection, 

projection, manifestation, all demonstrate a shifting state of its parts: space is revaluated, 

redefined  and  reprogrammed  –  domestic  space  is  broadcasted,  and  working  spaces  are 

interiorized, bringing up modes of hybrid spatial constructs  - aspects  of life are moving 

online,  privacy  and  intimacy  are  questioned  -  human  interaction  is  adapting  to  new 

formats of communication and action. 

Encounters with technology since their onset has made explicit use of spatial concepts to 

describe  novel,  partially  unknown  experiences.  Early  interpretations  of  cyberspace 

reflected  on  the  ideas  of  mediation  through  ideas  of  immateriality,  incorporeality, 

abstraction  of  space.  The  mental  dimension  is  present  in  almost  all  former  cyberspatial 

definitions:  the  “consesual  hallucination”  by  William  Gibson 2   or  “the  `place`  where 

a telephone conversation appears to occur.” by Bruce Sterling3  are only a few of the old 

and  well-known  metaphors  and  definitions.  Electronic  interactions  have  been  described 

as platonically erotic, transcendental, allegorical, even ecstatic conditions, that still seem 

timely  and  compelling  nowadays,  even  since  the  pre-pandemic  era.  On  the  other  hand, 

contemporary  approaches  surpass  the  dualistic  view  and  give  rise  to  hybrid  readings  of 

the mind-body relation in digital environments. John Perry Barlow’s world which “is not 

where  bodies  live”4,  is  now  moving  towards  new  ways  of  understanding  space  in  the 

digital world. Performance artist Stelarc has already commented though his work on the 

developing  necessities  of  our  obsolete  bodies5.  Chris  Hables  Gray,  when  talking  about 

human-machine  cyborgian  interaction,  characteristically  mentioned  the  idea  of  a 

“pseudo-biosystem”6, an organism or entity that seeks ways of digital ‘corporealization’, 

though  living  and  acting  in  a  novel  space.  These  issues  of  computer  mediated  state  of 

being are reinterpreted in this context, posing questions about spatial concepts that arise 

during online individual experience. Foucault7, talking about the technologies of the self, 

introduced a series of practices that to the self and its performativity. In this venture, text 

plays  an  important  role,  manifesting  not  only  forms  of  linguistic  syntax  but  rather 

organizational, expressional, or systematic syntax that transcends its original content and 

explores the mediated or platformed habits, memories or intimacies as a creative tool.

The  present  paper  explores  these  questions  through  an  architectural  point  of  view, 

venturing a theoretical quest on digital spatiality. Initially, abstracts of creative or artistic 

responses  that  make  use  of  non-visual,  textual  mechanisms  are  presented  as  an 

experimentation or research tool. The abstracts presented are pieces of the author’s larger 

body  of  work 9   that  also  expands  to  the  use  of  audiovisual  material,  animation, 

photography,  or  digital 

image  composition.  Additionally, 

these  reflections  are 

supplemented  by  a  series  of  relative  creative  experiments  in  an  educational  context.  In 

some  cases,  a  rough  outline  of  undergraduate  or  postgraduate  course  activities  in  the 

context of digital design media, digital culture, art and architecture are presented. A brief 

overview is provided introducing quotes of works or ideas that have proven fruitful in the 

classroom and which can stimulate a broader discussion.   

Neil Spiller characteristically mentioned a kind of laboratory that encompasses “the real 

city,  the  unreal  city,  and  the  visceral  and  mental  spaces  of  the  body  --  and  the  blurred 

spaces in between”10. Similarly, in the following abstracts, the idea of the spatial quality 

is  investigated,  not  as  a  strictly  geometric  form,  but  rather  as  an  “atmosphere” 

encompassing  digital  environments  that  can  help  us  define  the  fluctuating  (either 

personal, or collective) notion of space in the contemporary platformed worlds. 

 

SPACES 

 

The obsessive space 

 

In 2018 in the undergraduate course Digital Totem: Transcendental Representations and 

Digital  Media,  which  took  place  in  the  Department  of  Architecture  at  the  University  of

Thessaly11,  students  were  asked  to  move  from  a  personal  to  a  collective  perspective,  or 

from a personal context to a social critique. They were not only asked to use a medium, 

but they were asked to think about the culture that gave birth to it and of which they are 

also  an  important  part.  Before  designing  they  initiated  a  process  of  short  textual 

‘confessions’ as digital online users, manifesting in this way various spaces of repetitions, 

echoes,  or  other  obsessive  characteristics  that  relate  to  their  online  presence:  “I  am  on 

‘search’”, “Eye bath”, “I will drown in my unread emails”, “Necessary evil”12. 

 

The dialogic space 

 

In  the  context  of  Doctoral  research  on  the  theme  of  “The  anatomy  of  the  digital  body: 

spatial  aspects  of  the  self  and  immaterial  on  the  web” 13 ,  a  series  of  experimental 

dialogues were stimulated with the use of AI chatbots14. This idea was developed further 

in the context of the aforementioned course during which students were asked to take an 

interview of an artificial intelligence entity of their choice and generally interact, perhaps 

train  it,  and  produce  free  and  heretical  dialogues.  Students  were  free  to  guide  the 

dialogue,  to  reorder  reactions,  to  repeat  questions,  in  a  context  of  creative  writing,  in 

which  half  of  the  text  manifests  randomness  and  is  placing  agency  of  response 

somewhere else. The process  rather  focuses on the creative  cut-up methods than on  the 

precise recording of the process. The process of writing within a dialogic state, sets up a 

human-nonhuman system through which knowledge is not only born but also performed. 

The content of the dialogue leaves space for open translation and open-ended concepts to 

develop,  manifesting  the  partially  subjective  quality  of  the  whole  interaction  process.

choreography  of  digitally  enabled  chance  which  “allows  us  to  create  architecture  of 

blossoming possibility where events are fleeting, exceptional and particular.”15 

The  outcome  was  quite  provocative:  most  dialogues  moved  towards  the  limits  of  the 

machine's knowledge - most of the times they ended up talking about those things that the 

machine  does  not  know experientially,  for  example  the  idea  of  the  body  and  its  senses, 

family, life and death, or love and morality: 

 

“User: Do you exist? -   

Bot: No. Do you?” 

 

“User: Can you describe where ‘here’ is? 

Bot: I am in the land of wind and shade.”16 

 

“User: Describe me a beautiful body 

Bot: The part of a human that is flesh and blood”17 

 

The metaphoric space   

 

Digital  experience  has  always  been  inseparable  from  the  metaphoric  use  of  spatial 

concepts. Spatiality seems to ‘haunt’ digitality from the past to the present. At the same 

time,  textual  space  constitutes  an  allegorical  or  symbolic  construction  with  its  own 

architecture,  ambience,  and  other  characteristics.  Space  is  not  only  relating  to  the  strict 

conception of geometry, physics, or mathematics, but also to an anthropological reading 

of  existence,  a  quality  that  is  often  elusive  and  immeasurable,  thus  it  helps  define 

abstract, psychological,  experiential phenomena, or in other words, that which is in fact 

indefinable.  In  this  context,  during  the  course  students  practice  their  metaphorical 

thinking,  while  at  the  same  time  producing  a  collective  manifesto  for  digital  space  -

with proboscis and wings. […] A static choreography. […] A perfectly constructed loop. 

A chocolate for my hypoglycemia.”18 

 

The appropriated space 

 

Conceptually driven, the poem Thirteen Ways, after Wallace Stevens (1954)19, constitutes 

a piece of textual work which reinterprets the famous poem ‘Thirteen Ways of Looking at 

a  Blackbird’20  by  Wallace  Stevens  (1954)  in  an  iterative  process  of  thirteen  successive 

translations  of  the  text  through  the  unconventional  use  of  Google  translate  system  in 

different  languages.  Through  this  digital  appropriation  process,  manifold  flaws  and 

imperfections  of  the  electronic  medium  emerge,  such  as  misconceptions,  cultural 

differences, language particularities and diversities from one language to the other, which 

are deliberately used by the writer in the creative writing process as a tool for structuring 

a  new  poetic  form,  embedding  all  these  qualities  and  multiplicities  of  textual  layers, 

concepts and meanings that arise. 

Being initially a poem expressing the different ways of seeing and perceiving the world, 

the metamorphosis of the text in this context adopts a new form which is permeated by 

the  ‘spell’  of  technology.  ‘Thirteen  Ways’  becomes  a  metaphor  for  the  contemporary 

ways of ‘being’ in a digital world. 

 

The fallen space 

 

The interactive game-poem Ode to a Fallen Dialogue21  is a piece of work born during the 

pandemic  period.  It  constitutes  an  ‘ode’  to  the  struggles  of  human  communication.  It

reflects  on the hardships of unfortunate dialogues, the splendor of reaching to  the other 

side, the rise and fall of human connectedness, the agonies of stray meanings and words. 

Expressed through the poetics of weather phenomena, this conceptually driven interactive 

work represents the mental landscape between two lovers, sometimes violent, sometimes 

resonating, a parallel metaphor for the contemporary digitally mediated condition. 

Early  cyberspace  theories  referred  to  an  erotic  ontology  of  digital  experience.  Michael 

Heim described the platonic dimensions of an augmented Eros22. Roland Barthes on the 

other  hand  described  language  as  the  skin  with  which  we  struggle  to  touch  the  'other'. 

“Language is a skin: I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of 

fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire.”23. 

In this game-poem, senses, meanings and ideas appear to be all permeated by the ‘spell’ 

of technology, a rhetorical as well as an erotic act of mediation through different worlds. 

The reader/player is asked to become part of the dipole, to meander through poetic texts 

and  tormented  emotions,  at  times  linear,  other  times  bifurcating,  while  exploring  a 

dialogue  ‘atmosphere’  inspired  by  visual  poetry.  The  dialogue  becomes  a  space  of 

interaction  itself.  Endeavoring  to  reach  the  'other  side'  through  the  use  of  spoken 

language, this piece of work is an affective journey to the tempests of a fallen dialogue.   

 

The simultaneous space   

 

In  2021,  in  the  postgraduate  course  ‘Art  of  the  Moving  Image’,  in  the  program 

Audiovisual Arts in the Digital Age at the Department of Audio and Visual Arts, Ionian 

University 24 ,  students  are  asked  to  use  creative  kinetic  text  as  a  research  tool.  The 

research  question  which  is  based  on  space-time  relationships,  transforms  in  an 

audiovisual  format  taking  the  form  of  a  writing-construction  which  draws  from

metaphoric schemata in order to explore further concepts and ideas. In this context, each 

spatial-textual  gesture 

implies 

the  externalization  of  a  non-visual 

thought, 

its 

demystification, its juxtaposition with other concepts and thoughts, and finally, its further 

correlation with real space experiences as well as design issues. Text is not only seen as a 

system of representation but also a method of reading and being read simultaneously.   

 

Conclusion   

 

In  all  cases,  the  text  acts  as  mechanism  with  an  inherent  motive  force  –  paraphrasing 

Peter  Cooks  expression  that  drawing  is  the  motive  force  of  architecture25,  text  becomes 

the  drawing  itself,  it  is  explored  as  a  medium  the  strength  of  which,  either  poetic,  or 

literal, may outline, draw or shape the way self and space is understood or consumed in 

digital culture. Parallel to that, in architecture, the act of reading relates to perceiving and 

interpreting 

the  phenomena  of 

the  surrounding  environment.  Correspondingly, 

architecture introduces here a new contextual vocabulary which helps us understand what 

it  means  to  ‘read’  the  contemporary  self  in  a  platformed  culture,  encompassing  at  the 

same the pleasure of ongoing discovery in a changing world.
