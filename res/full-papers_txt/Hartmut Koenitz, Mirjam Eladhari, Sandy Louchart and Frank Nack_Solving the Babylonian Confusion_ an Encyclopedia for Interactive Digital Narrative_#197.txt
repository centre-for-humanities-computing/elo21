Abstract	The	design	and	study	of	interactive	digital	narratives	(IDN)	is	a	multidisciplinary	field.	
Scholars	and	practitioners	concerned	with	the	topic	originate	from	fields	such	as	literary	studies,	
computer	sciences,	games	studies,	media	studies,	fine	art,	filmmaking.	Consequently,	they	not	
only	bring	a	wealth	of	productive	perspectives	to	the	table,	but	also	differences	in	terminology.	
This	fact	alone	can	be	a	cause	for	confusion,	yet	it	is	further	amplified	by	diverging	meanings	of	
the	same	term	in	different	disciplinary	contexts.	In	the	field,	there	is	a	long-standing	issue,	we	
propose	concrete	steps	towards	the	development	of	a	shared	vocabulary	in	the	form	of	an	online	
encyclopedia,	taking	inspiration	from	the	Living	Handbook	of	Narratology	and	the	Stanford	
Encyclopedia	of	Philosophy.	This	work	is	developed	in	the	INDCOR	EU	COST	action,	a	network	
currently	encompassing	160	members	from	37	countries.

1  Addressing the Lack of a Shared Vocabulary for IDN 
The	lack	of	a	shared	vocabulary	is	a	longstanding	issue	in	the	field	of	interactive	digital	narratives	
(IDN)	(Koenitz,	Ferri,	and	Sezen	2009;	Koenitz	et	al.	2013;	Koenitz	2014;	Koenitz	2016;	Thue	and	
	
1	A	longer	version	of	this	paper	has	been	published	as	an	INDCOR	white	paper	on	the	pre-print	server	
arxiv	https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10135:	

2	
	
Carstensdottir	2018).	The	root	of	this	problem	is	the	fact	that	scholars	and	practitioners	
concerned	with	the	topic	of	interactive	narrative	originate	in	a	number	of	different	fields,	
including	literature	studies,	film	studies,	computer	sciences	(both	from	an	Artificial	Intelligence	
(AI)	and	Human	Computer	Interaction	(HCI)	perspective),	media	studies,	creative	practices	and	
many	more.	All	of	these	fields	have	associated	specific	vocabulary.	The	issue	is	further	aggravated	
by	the	fact	that	many	common	terms	used	in	Interactive	Digital	Narrative	research	and	practice	
–	such	as	“narrative”,	“plot”	or	“story”	–	have	both	a	common	meaning	in	everyday	conversation,	
and	also	specific	ones	in	scholarly	and	professional	contexts.	The	‘story’	of	a	journalist	is	not	
exactly	the	same	as	the	‘story’	of	a	film	director	and	what	is	exactly	meant	in	each	case	is	only	fully	
accessible	to	practitioners	in	the	respective	fields.	In	a	recent	article	Koenitz	and	Eladhari	
compared	this	status	to	the	biblical	metaphor	of	the	“Babylonian	confusion”	(2019).	
In	this	paper,	we	propose	to	address	the	issue	through	the	creation	of	a	“living	encyclopedia	of	
IDN	vocabulary”	based	on	an	overarching	analytical	framework	(SPP	model)	and	associated	
taxonomy.	We	detail	the	process	for	the	creation	and	continued	development	of	such	a	resource	
within	INDCOR	(Interactive	Narrative	Design	for	COmplexity	Representations)	EU	COST	
network3	and	also	invite	the	community	to	participate	in	the	development	of	this	central	aspect	
for	the	fledgling	field	of	IDN	research	and	practice.		
2 
Foundational Considerations for a Shared Vocabulary  
In	order	to	enable	such	a	shared	understanding,	an	overarching	analytical	perspective	is	
necessary.	This	is	an	insight	gained	by	our	own	experience	in	the	INDCOR	EU	COST	network.	The	
setup	of	workgroups	was	a	bottom-up	approach	developed	by	the	expert	community	at	the	first	
meeting	in	Brussels.	As	work	progressed,	a	long	list	of	terms	to	be	defined	in	a	shared	vocabulary	
was	quickly	produced,	but	subsequent	discussions	made	clear	that	a	consensus	on	how	to	connect	
different	definitions	was	elusive.	Consequently,	we	identified	the	need	of	an	overarching	
abstraction	to	guide	our	work	on	a	shared	vocabulary	of	IDN.	Without	it,	there	was	a	manifest	risk	
that	a	shared	vocabulary	would	replicate	the	existing	Babylonian	confusion	and	thus	miss	its	
central	aim.	In	ongoing	work	and	subsequent	meetings	in	Vienna	and	online,	the	SPP	(System	
Process	Product)	model	(Koenitz	2015)	was	the	one	singled	out	across	workgroups	that	could	
function	as	a	starting	point	for	connecting	the	four	pillars	that	are	expressed	as	workgroups	in	
INDCOR.

2.1 An Overarching Analytical Perspective: the SPP Model 

3	
The	SPP	model	is	a	media-specific	perspective	that	identifies	three	broad	categories	for	the	
analysis	of	IDN	artefacts,	reflecting	its	different	stages:	system	–	the	digital	artifact,	process	–	the	
interactive	experience	of	a	system,	and	product	–	the	result	of	the	experience,	either	in	the	form	
of	a	recording	or	as	a	retelling	(Eladhari	2018)	to	others	(figure	1).		
	

Figure	1.	SPP	model	(Koenitz	2015)	

	

	

The	SPP	model	takes	the	systemic,	dynamic	character	of	IDN	works	as	its	central	characteristic,	
building	on	a	foundation	laid	by	cybernetics	(Wiener	1948),	and	cybernetic	art	theory	(Ascott	
1964;	Ascott	1968),	as	well	as	earlier	perspectives	on	interactive	forms	of	narration	(Laurel	1986;	
Jennings	1996;	Murray	1997;	Montfort	2005;	Murray	2011).	In	order	to	understand	the	specific	
aspects	of	IDN	and	avoid	limitations	inherent	in	adapted	perspectives4,	the	SPP	model	does	not	
rely	on	underlying	models	derived	from	the	classical	formal	study	of	literature	and	the	cinema	in	
narratology.	Instead,	it	acknowledges	the	‘cognitive	turn’	in	narratology	–	a	perspective	that	
understands	narrative	not	as	a	property	of	certain	types	of	artefacts,	but	as	a	cognitive	function,	
a	“frame	for	constructing,	communicating,	and	reconstructing	mentally	projected	worlds”	
(Herman	2002).	This	perspective	opens	up	a	space	for	novel	kinds	of	narrative	manifestations	–	
as	in	principle	any	artefact	can	be	considered	a	narrative	as	long	as	it	triggers	the	cognitive	frame	
of	narrative.	In	other	words:	an	IDN	work	does	not	need	to	be	similar	to	the	literary	novel	or	the	
movie	to	be	considered	a	narrative.	This	view	creates	opportunities	for	both	theoretical	
development	and	novel	practices.		
	
4	Cf.	N.	Katherine	Hayles’	call	for	a	“media-specific	analysis”	of	digital	forms	of	narration	(Hayles	2002)	
and	Hausken’s	warning	of	“media	blindness”	(2004).	

4	
	
On	this	basis,	the	SPP	model	is	concerned	with	defining	aspects	of	IDN	systems,	their	processes	
and	resulting	 products	and	organizes	related	concepts	and	design	aspects	accordingly.	For	
instance,	 system	contains	the	 protostory,	the	sum	of	all	potential	narratives	that	can	be	
instantiated	with	a	given	artefact	(figure	2).	Further	aspects	related	to	an	IDN	work	(narrative	
design,	 user	 interface,	 assets,	 environment	 definitions/rule	 systems)	are	subcategories	of	
protostory.	This	would	mean	for	example	that	an	AI	engine	is	described	as	a	rule	system	within	
the	protostory	and	its	particular	implementation	as	a	part	of	the	narrative	design.	Conversely,	
concepts,	practices	and	examples	related	to	the	manner	in	which	an	IDN	is	presented	to	and	
experienced	by	an	audience	(i.e.	visual	presentation,	interaction,	feedback)	would	be	represented	
within	the	category	of	 process.	Finally,	 product	describes	the	output	of	a	 process,	either	as	a	
recording	(objective	product)	or	as	re-telling	(Eladhari	2018)	(subjective	product).	
	

	
Figure	2.	Protostory	and	its	elements	(Koenitz	2015)	

	For	the	shared	vocabulary	project,	the	SPP	model	is	used	as	a	foundational	analytical	
framework	to	connect	central	concepts	of	IDN	in	terms	of	design	and	development,	theory	
building,	societal	context	and	evaluation.	This	choice	is	pragmatic,	based	on	several	advantages:	
	
SPP	emphasizes	the	specificity	of	this	dynamic	form	thus	providing	a	clear	distinction	from	
earlier,	fixed	forms	of	narrative	such	as	the	printed	novel	or	film	and	associated	vocabulary	
and	thus	avoids	the	pitfalls	of	re-defining	existing	terminology;	
-  The	SPP	model	takes	the	systemic	nature	of	IDN	artifacts	as	foundational,	building	on	a	
solid	lineage	of	cybernetics,	cybernetic	art	and	system	theory;	
-  The	SPP	model	continues	efforts	by	scholars	such	as	Pamela	Jennings,	Brenda	Laurel,	Janet	
Murray	and	Nick	Montfort	in	understanding	the	specific	aspects	of	Interactive	Digital	
Narratives;		

- 

	

5	
-  The	SPP	model	features	an	inclusive	view	that	acknowledges	the	wide	variety	of	different	
forms	of	IDN,	including	hypertexts,	journalistic	interactives,	narrative-focused	video	
games,	interactive	documentaries,	installation	pieces,	and	AR/VR	work	as	well	as	emerging	
forms;		
-  The	SPP	model	provides	a	high-level	model	of	IDN	works	and	their	relationship	with	their	
audiences	that	is	open	both	to	extensions	and	further	lower-level	specification	and	thus	the	
SPP	model	can	serve	as	a	central	element	in	an	IDN	taxonomy.	
 Any	choice	of	overarching	analytical	perspective	is	open	to	criticism	and	will	be	controversial	
to	some	researchers	and/or	professionals,	yet	there	is	the	simple	fact	that	a	starting	point	must	
be	chosen	and	given	the	above-mentioned	advantages,	the	SPP	model	provides	a	solid	foundation.		
A	shared	vocabulary	does	not	mean	that	all	differences	in	meaning	or	historical	context	would	
simply	disappear,	or	that	scholarly	dispute	all	of	a	sudden	ends,	but	that	a	coordinate	system	
would	be	established	against	which	extensions	and	alternative	views	can	be	discussed	and	
understood.	Conversely,	from	this	clear	vantage	point,	explicit	connections	can	be	drawn	which	
will	enable	scholars	to	better	understand	each	other	and	productively	work	together.	Most	
importantly,	since	we	aim	to	make	the	concept	of	a	shared	vocabulary	available	for	the	whole	
community	of	researchers	and	designers,	it	can	serve	as	a	hub	for	knowledge	exchange	and	an	
important	step	in	building	a	field	accessible	also	to	newcomers	and	related	disciplines.		
3  A Taxonomy for IDN – Extending the SPP Model 
The	SPP	model	is	concerned	with	analyzing	the	IDN	artifact,	which	means	it	does	neither	
explicitly	cover	the	conditions	leading	to	a	work	(Ideation)	nor	its	creation	process	(Authoring).	
Conversely,	it	also	does	not	concern	itself	with	societal	effects	of	the	work	in	question	or	on	other	
works	(Critical	discourse).	As	a	broad	framework,	it	also	does	not	provide	the	granularity	
necessary	for	an	encyclopedia.	Consequently,	the	authors	of	this	paper	have	developed	a	
taxonomy	for	interactive	digital	narrative	on	the	basis	of	the	SPP	model	with	the	top-level	
categories	of	authoring,	artefact	and	critical	discourse	(table	1).		
The	taxonomy	relates	authors’	contributions	to	an	overall	structure.	For	example,	transformation	
is	categorized	as	an	aesthetic	quality	and	thus	an	aim	during	the	authoring	process	(Authoring	>	
Ideation	>	Content	>	Aesthetic	qualities	>Transformation)	and	an	element	of	the	experience	of	
successful	design	(Artefact	>	Process	>	Experience	>	Aesthetic	>	Transformation)	
We	understand	this	taxonomy	as	a	first	effort	(version	1.0)	open	to	changes	and	amendments	
as	the	result	of	discussions	and	developments	in	INDCOR	as	well	as	in	the	research	and	practice	
communities	at	large.		

6	
	
The	taxonomy	itself	represents	the	core	of	the	shared	vocabulary	and	as	such	provides	a	
foundation	which	supports	the	community-driven	effort	in	developing	a	more	extensive	
collection	of	terminology.	This	explicitly	means	that	further	terms	should	be	proposed	and	will	
be	integrated	to	grow	the	vocabulary.	The	focus	here	will	be	on	concepts	not	already	well-defined	
in	existing	collections,	e.g.	The	Living	Handbook	of	Narratology	(Hühn,	2015)

4  A (Living) Encyclopedia for IDN 
With	the	foundational	staxonomy	in	place,	the	question	is	how	to	make	the	project	accessible	
and	enable	community	involvement	and	further	development.	Examples	for	accessible	shared	
vocabularies	exist	in	the	form	of	online	encyclopedias	and	this	is	the	model	we	have	decided	to	
follow.	Arguably	the	most	successful	example	for	general	knowledge	is	Wikipedia	(2020b),	the	
free	online	encyclopedia.	In	the	scholarly	realm,	two	particularly	successful	examples	are	the	
Living	Handbook	of	Narratology	(Hühn	2015)	and	the	Stanford	Encyclopedia	of	Philosophy	
(2020a).	Both	Wikipedia	and	the	scholarly	resources	are	viable	models.	We	aim	to	follow	the	
latter	model	for	a	variety	of	reasons	and	will	be	developing	an	online	encyclopedia	for	IDN	
research	and	practice.		
An	argument	for	creating	an	encyclopedia	rather	than	a	shared	Wikipedia	is	that,	based	on	the	
examples	above,	these	endeavors	have	proven	more	successful	in	terms	of	creating	a	complete	
and	high-quality	curated	result.	The	reasons	for	this	outcome	are	likely	multifold,	but	we	
speculate	that	an	encyclopedia	entry	is	more	rewarding	for	authors	to	participate	in,	since	their	
efforts	are	clearly	recognizable	and	properly	credited.	As	for	its	audience,	an	encyclopedia	
appears	to	be	more	curated	in	both	its	individual	content,	and	as	a	whole,	since	an	encyclopedia	
by	its	nature	promises	to	provide	a	more	comprehensive	view	of	a	given	topic,	rather	than	to	rely	
on	seemingly	random	selections	and	emphasis	determined	by	wiki-authors’	preferences.	This	
being	said,	the	two	methods	are	not	mutually	exclusive.	A	Wikipedia	site	could	likely	serve	well	
as	a	pre-stage	in	the	production	of	the	Encyclopedia	of	IDN	the	way	we	envision	it.		
Taking	inspiration	from	the	two	examples	of	the	Living	Handbook	of	Narratology	(Hühn	2015)	
and	the	Stanford	Encyclopedia	of	Philosophy	(2020a),	we	see	a	strong	editorial	board	as	central	to	
the	success	of	this	undertaking,	providing	guidance	and	assuring	academic	excellence.	
Conversely,	we	consider	community	engagement	as	crucial	in	making	this	undertaking	a	success,

which	means	to	aim	at	a	good	balance	of	both	aspects.	Therefore,	the	IDN	encyclopedia	will	be	
composed	of	articles	written	by	authors	from	the	community	which	have	undergone	a	thorough	
peer-review	process.	Articles	will	be	published	based	on	their	academic	rigor	and	the	relevance	
of	their	contribution	to	the	field.		
The	group	of	INDCOR	chairs	(nine	scholars	originating	in	different	disciplines	and	at	different	
career	stages5)	will	act	as	the	initial	editorial	board	and	section	editors,	soliciting	authors	from	
inside	the	project	and	the	community	at	large	for	encyclopedia	entries.	At	the	time	of	writing,	in	
May	2021,	the	INDCOR	action	consists	of	more	than	160	scholarly	experts	and	professionals	
concerned	with	IDN	complexity	representations.	INDCOR	members	would	act	as	the	initial	group	
of	reviewers,	but	will	be	inviting	additional	experts	from	the	field	to	assure	a	diversity	of	
perspectives	and	a	high	level	of	quality	content	also	for	topics	outside	their	core	expertise.	The	
aim	is	to	make	the	encyclopedia	a	high-quality	resource	where	each	entry	is	recognized	as	a	
publication	in	its	own	right	and	thus	writing	for	the	encyclopedia	is	a	rewarding	undertaking	for	
contributors.

Conclusion and Future Work 
In	this	paper,	we	have	identified	the	lack	of	a	shared	vocabulary	as	a	central	issue	for	the	field	
of	Interactive	Digital	Narrative	in	general.	We	further	identified	the	need	for	an	overarching	
analytical	perspective,	selected	the	SPP	model	in	this	capacity	and	have	proposed	to	address	this	
issue	through	a	communal	expert-authored	and	peer-reviewed	encyclopedia.	Inspired	by		the	
successful	examples	of	the	Living	Handbook	of	Narratology	and	the	Stanford	Encyclopedia	of	
Philosophy,	we	propose	a	structure	for	such	an	effort	and	introduce	a	taxonomy	as	a	starting	point	
to	gather	definitions	of	concepts	central	to	IDN	and	useful	across	perspectives	for	scholars	and	
practitioners	in	the	field,	taking	into	account	four	
lenses:	design	and	development,	
conceptualization	and	theory,	evaluation,	and	societal	context.	We	invite	the	research	community	
to	partake	in	the	endeavor	of	creating	a	multifaceted,	living	encyclopedia	providing	a	shared	
vocabulary	for	IDN.
