1. There are more abstracts than papers.
2. Some papers lack an ID.


There are two full papers that do not have ID & are not in abstracts: 
"Augustin Berti_Nanofundia ELO" & "Final (500 word) Proposal_Ocean as Media Platform for Electronic Literature". 

Additionally, paper "199" strays from the pattern by not having preceeding '#'

Many more abstracts than full papers (103 vs. 61/60). 

All of the papers with IDs can be matched.
