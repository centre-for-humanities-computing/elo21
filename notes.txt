1. There are more abstracts than papers.
2. Some papers lack an ID.

There are two full papers that do not have ID & are not in abstracts: 
"Augustin Berti_Nanofundia ELO" & "Final (500 word) Proposal_Ocean as Media Platform for Electronic Literature". 

Additionally, paper "199" strays from the pattern by not having preceeding '#'

Many more abstracts than full papers (103 vs. 61/60). 

All of the papers with IDs can be matched. 

paper 192 (Claus...) is weird.

at least one paper (not the abstract) which is not text but image (has been filtered out).
